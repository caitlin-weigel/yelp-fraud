"1","The food was good. Understaffed beyond belief! Servers running around like crazy, food taking forever to come out of the kitchen (can't really be the servers fault because the orders are being sent in from the handheld device at the table). We split our group in two because the wait was so long, and one table got food 25 minutes before the other, both ordered at the same time.From the sound of it, this is a normal occurrence when they get busy. If they are anywhere close to full, you might want to pick somewhere else."
"2","Great place for breakfast...love M @ M Omlets! And corned beef hash!"
"3","Oh how I wish there were options here past 10pm. We arrived, sat down, waited, waited, waited, witnessed waitresses fighting, waited, waited, were approached by a waitress, ordered, waited, waited, waited, waited. We watched tables just get up and leave, waited, waited. Watched tables ask for their check and wait, we waited, waited, waited. We are still waiting, but about to leave (it's been over an hour now). Our less than mediocre wings arrived, delivered by a server we hadn't seen before or would see again. 30 minutes later a server walked by, we caught their attention and asked for the check.I didn't expect much and we didn't get much but they still managed to disappoint us! Well done."
"4","Server was nice..but food took wayyy too long. We were there for two hours! Got two cokes an app and 2 orders of wings. Table was sticky also"
"5","They allow the Mom's to bring their kids to the bar???? I guess if you say something it would be worse, smh."
"6","Bdubs Bdubs, the only consistency I have found when dining at Bdubs is slow service and poor quality of food. Bdubs amazes me to take their time to take our order and serve us food. The group that I was with waited 20-30 minutes to get our orders taken, and then almost another hour to get our food. In addition, the food itself is greasy and lacking flavor. Bdubs is the place to visit to watch TV, and spend money on overpriced, low quality food."
"7","The sauce is great and there are a ton of TVs. That's really the end of the good things about this place. Every time I go there I'm disappointed with the service. Servers and bartenders don't to care very much about customer service and generally take their time getting around to you. I've been eating their wings since way back when they were still called BW3, so every few months I get nostalgic and think let me give it another shot. But I don't bother dining in anymore, it's strictly a carry out affair now."
"8","DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! I came to celebrate my sister's graduation and the service here was terrible. Our table of 5 waited 15 minutes for our fountain drinks alone. We waited another 20+ minutes for an appetizer and when we asked the waitress for silverware she brought us plastic utinsils. After waiting a while longer for the food our waitress shared with the table there was a mix up with our orders and that our ticket was lost. We were at the establishment for over 50 minutes with only an appitizer and no refills on our drinks. We ended up leaving hungry  after talking to the manager. This place would be getting 1 star, but their manger showed his concern with our disappointment and made an effort to turn the night around. Nevertheless, I would not recommend."
"9","Update on my previous review. It's hard for me to knock a rating down, but the service is just...something else. I love me some chicken wings and their potato wedges, but it's not really possible to go in for a quick meal. Maybe that is why their takeout is so popular. I'd still come to Bdubs, but just plan your time accordingly."
"10","I returned here with my parents on a Sunday night because they wanted to watch a football game. I've been told multiple times, ""What do you expect? It's bar food!"" with regard to places like Buffalo Wild Wings, but I was newly disappointed on this occasion. Our server was pleasant but seemed not to be able to answer questions directly, which was moderately annoying. It's been a few days and I was very tired, so I don't remember what question was asked, but I do remember that moment being one where I had to re-ask the question to get answer. It was also pretty dead in there and it took a long while for our food to arrive.With regard to the food, my father ordered the popcorn shrimp as an appetizer. It was ok, but pretty bland. Basically deep fried shrimp. The sauce alongside it was especially mediocre; barely even cocktail sauce with no spice to it. I ordered as an entree the shrimp po'boy. Now this dish was a complete disappointment. Basically, it's the popcorn shrimp inside of a bun with some vegetables and a creamy mayonnaise. I know I'll be dragged back here by my parents, but I will attempt to avoid this place until then. I honestly hope this location closes and a local business takes over. Expansion for the Fairmount or Luna? That would be awesome."
"11","Sad this is the closest BWW to me, because it is by far the worst I've been to. The service has always been slow here, not a big deal, but now is also unfriendly and poor, so after 1.5 years of frequenting, I will no longer be going back ever again. On my most recent visit (when the restaurant was not busy at all btw), our waiter was clearly so unhappy to be working, took 20 minutes to even take our drink orders, got multiple drink and food orders wrong, didn't bring obvious things like napkins, would take 10 minutes to track him down to ask for napkins. Will just have to drive further to a different location."
"12","Unlike my other Cleveland BWW review, this place was nice. Parking was a bit tight but there was plenty of room inside. We asked to get a specific baseball game on the TV and they were able to get that done pretty quick. We had Beer and Wings and they both came out fast and tasty, overall a nice BWW"
"13","1) waited 45 min for 2 beers2) waited 2.5 hours for a sandwich and salad - then waited another 5 min for silverware 3) couldn't see a Cavs playoff game due to softball, wresting, golf and bdubs trivia taking up tvs4) when food finally came out, ALL orders were incorrect5) after all of that that there was no offer for compensation -  I had to tell the waitress we weren't payingIf it were possible to give 0 stars, I would. please do yourself a favor and support the cavs elsewhere, because Bdubs does not value the game or proper service during one."
"14","Plus: lot of TVs, show boxing and UFC fights in addition to other sports, multiple ""wings"" optionsMinus: staff, service, quality of foodWe went to BWW to see a UFC fight since this was one of the closest places for us in University Circle. We walked in and were greeted by a semi-polite staff member who told us to sit wherever we wanted and that they would show the UFC fight once it was time! Ok, we pick a seat and within 2 seconds our server comes to the table and asks us what we want...""water for now, give us a minute to decide"" we said since it was literally seconds since we sat down. She follows that up with a rude ""is that all."" Never mind, we wanted to focus on the fight since we are a bunch of enthusiasts so we let it slide.After that poof.... Our server is MIA. After 10 minutes of scanning the room we finally flag her down to give our drink order while simultaneously attempt to order some food lest we lose her again. The ordering portion was extremely unpleasant as she kept interrupting my friend whose English is not perfect. Give him a chance to say what he has to! He was trying to see if he could customize the sampler plate but Our server was in no mood to help him and retorted ""they don't allow us to change anything in the sampler, do you want it or not.""  Finally,We gave up and just ordered what was on the menu.In 5 minutes we get our drinks and in another 15 minutes our food. Since we had requested the mozzarella sticks to be separate from the meat/nachos at the time of our order and since that was not the case when our food arrived,another server offered to get us a new plate of mozzarella sticks. So she goes to do so and on the way mentions it to our server, but she didn't come back to say anything (like it never happened). Ok, it might not have been your fault but at least you can acknowledge the mistake.We ate, drank and our server dropped the check: she never asked us if we were done, and there was still an hour left for the fight. So lady, if I want more drinks should I just get them at the bar? Overall, the nachos and mozzarella sticks were decent, wings felt a little cold. I still appreciate the staff coming us with another plate of mozzarella sticks due to the mistake in the kitchen. However, the remaining service experience was sub-par. Like other yelpers have said, it's kind of a hit and miss so don't expect a lot.You get drinks, ok food and multiple TVs to watch all the sports you wish to watch."
"15","They get 2 stars instead of 1 because they have lots of TVs for watching games, but wow the service here is unbearably slow.What motivated me to write this review is that I had three Guinesses over the course of the game and each time they came out looking like the photo -- a ridiculous amount of foam. The bartender was clearly never instructed on how to pour, dump the foam, wait and poor again. It's a rudimentary skill that all bartenders quickly grasp, but not here."

"19","Go to Winking Lizard. Service was poor, food was lackluster. We had an order come out wrong (it was inputted incorrectly), and the server who delivered it tried to convince us it was right. We got another server to take the food back and put in the correct order. By the time the correct order came back, the rest of us were done.At any decent restaurant (e.g. Winking Lizard) a manager would volunteer to deal with this in some way - no charge for the food or comping one of the beers. I've been in this situation before, and I return to restaurants that do their best to right their wrongs. Instead, we were informed by the server that nothing could be done because we ate the food (that arrived 25 minutes late). The manager similarly argued that he couldn't do anything because we ate it. He ultimately agreed to a discount on the single food item, but he was surly about it - no one from the restaurant owned their mistake.In short, eat local, and keep these kind of chains that care more about the bottom line than their patrons out of our neighborhood. I suggest Winking Lizard."

"21","The service is always poor and the servants like talking to a person but not checking other customers."
"22","I ordered Parmesan garlic wings and received a box of sauce with wings in it. Definitely don't like to dine at places that don't appear to care about my food."
"23","Food is always alright once you get it and they usually get your order right.  The WAIT is awful.  I hate waiting while you can see empty tables.  I would much rather be seated and sipping on a coke waiting. This has to be the worst managed restaurant ever.  When you do have problems manager always have an excuse and never an apology or what can I do to make it right attitude.  I have been here with our family and extended family where they food was so slow to come out that people were done eating before the last person got their food.  I only go here as a last resort."
"24","Nearly every time I visit Olive Garden's Harvard Park location, the bartender allows dirty dishes to accumulate, and linger on the bar for long periods of time. I sat at the bar for almost an hour, and saw no effort being made to clean off the bar.  The restaurant wasn't even busy. Apparently, keeping a clean bar is not a priority to any of the bartenders at this location, as I've witnessed this problem for years."
"25","Never got my ""endless"" soup salad and breadsticks. Hair in my pasta. When we asked for more salad and breadsticks she came over 15 minutes later and said would we be paying cash or credit."
"26","I have always been a fan of Olive Garden. This location seems to be very popular and can have up to a two hour wait, so plan ahead. Once in, the staff is very friendly and attentive. I am a picky eater but my requests didn't seem to phase them. I was pleased with the speed of service we received and will likely come back to this location (making sure that there is no wait ahead of time)."
"27","I've never been to an Olive Garden and never will because unlike some people I know the difference between good food and some thing that was cooked up and shipped from Mexico.  They probably have rabbit instead of chicken and the people they call chefs probably walked over from their job at the nearest Taco Bell.  I'm sorry if you like this place but it's obvious that you mistook this place for a Chipotle."
"28","Terrible. The meat sauce was absolutely tasteless. The meatballs were just, not worth any amount of money. They are literally just a ball of beef that's been boiled. It's sooo bad. If Olive Garden wants to rebrand they should focus on keeping all of their branches on the same page."
"29","I was here for business trip and Panera was closer to the hotel so I went in. The place was clean and spacious. The lady who helped me at the cashier had an attitude which she telling me that store will be closed in few mins, which is nonsense. They had full hour of business to be open. I guess she didn't want to work. I ordered a sandwich and a cup of soup, and my mother ordered same combo but a different sandwich. The iced coffee which they had at the counter was way water Dow iced coffee. It wasn't good at all. Couple mins later, we got our food. The food looks present well. The soup was lukewarm and not hot. The sandwich was not bad but too much pepper. I guess it's a Cleveland thing?"
"30","I love Panera and I go to college nearby, so I find myself coming here occasionally. Unfortunately, the service is terrible. My order is either wrong or they forget it completely. Moreover, the Mediterranean veggie sandwich I usually get at other Paneras is way smaller in size at this location - totally not worth the $7. If you're hungry, you'd probably be better off going to the chipotle next door."
"31","Tough day for this Panera store.  While waiting to order I watch three employees trying to figure out who ordered what.  A poor guy is standing waiting for his bagels while they try bag up cinnamon rolls.  No biggie, except it was an indication to a disorganized, slow and frankly messy experience.I order my sandwich, get my large drink cup and have to ask where I get my food. Around the corner, I fill my drink and stand for literally 20+ minutes while others pass me by.  Including a worker who gets her own food while we stand and wait.  They holler that they are sorry but they are waiting on eggs.  Ok.  Others then walk up, wait and then get their EGG sandwiches while I continue to stand...  I ask if my order had been lost. ""Nope, getting to it right now.  A lot of things aren't ready""Ok...  then they don't have the right cheese.  I don't really care.  Yellow vs white cheddar.  Fine.I'm finally handed my ""to go"" bag, though it was for here. Ok, again.I head upstairs and there are chairs piled up in the corner... I sit at a table and it's covered in crumbs.  I wipe down the chair.My sandwich was squashed.  It tasted decent, yes, and why I didn't give only one star.I walk to the drinks upstairs because I've now been here for quite a while and wanted a second refill. There is one unmarked tea/coffee/mystery dispenser.  I opt for a known commodity and soda.  The fountain practically sprays me, but hey, at least there was no actual soda in it.  Just soda water.  I dump the non-soda and sit down to start to write this...It seems that there is disorganized management.  A culture that has accepted mediocre service.  The culture is such that I'd expect a defensive response to this review.  I wouldn't expect them to take responsibility.  If it were a culture of personal responsibility, I wouldn't have needed to write this in the first place.At least the wifi is fast!"
"32","You would think a Panera would be the same anywhere you go, but that's not really the case here. I have gone to this place thousands of times (maybe not that much) and the food is fine, but the service definitely could be better. I have had my order messed up or never made a few times, and that kinda bugs me. Sometimes I feel like the workers are more interested in talking to each other about their personal lives, rather than speeding up the process for the customer...Maybe it is just me, but the free WIFI never works, which is a bummer because this place has 2 stories of tables just primed for studying students."
"33","Ordered a broth bowl, I swear they gave me half what they advertised."

"35","I go to Panera Bread often because I know what they serve and that it will be consistent. Usually they have very nice staff. Not this Panera. I was the only person in line and the staff was lackadaisical at best. When my coffee came up, they said they called my name I sure didn't hear them, but they never repeated it. They were not busy with customers. The apathy put me off. The egg sandwich was runny all down my shirt. When an egg sandwich is ordered one expects it to be done so it doesn't run all over your clothes. Poor customer service."
"36","Don't expect much from this location. We just ordered a fair amount of food at a hefty price and almost every order was messed up. We did the online ordering and things were clearly omitted, however, found their way onto every order and paid for items that were not included. Also the poor attitude of whomever answered to phone when we called to check if the order was ready, was completely uncalled for. If you like salty attitudes, your order wrong and paying for things you don't get, this is the place for you. But if you want decent service and  getting what you order avoid this location!!"
"37","Terrible service!We called in an order for pick up and every single thing was wrong. No chicken on salad, cold grilled cheese, no dressing for salads, bad avocados. Terrible service and food."
"38","My wife ordered (online) chicken noodle soup and a whole baguette, and a Greek salad for me.My meal should have come with bread... but they left it out.  The Greek salad was awful. Almost no olives and almost no feta. And the left out all the bread.I went back... for the bread and they still shortchanged us... the one piece that should have come with my terrible Greek salad.  The manager apologized without even looking at me.Terrible place. They simply seem not to care.  The manager was the one who looked at the online order and still got it wrong. If you go there best to check every item before leaving.  Lots of other alternatives. Panera... are you listening?"
"39","Ok so i have order online or mobile a fee times. 2 times the have messed my order up. The first time the didn't put my mixed berry yogurt with my order. The manager comp me a cup of coffee. The next time the wrong sandwich was made or given. The place needs some real TLC. Not happy. So the lady taking care of me with the mixed up sandwich doesn't offer me anything. No apologies no comp coffee nothing. I have to ask for a comp coffee. Please learn some customer service or i will take my hard earned money to Starbucks!!!!! And another thing where is my spoon for my parfait????"
"40","Staff clueless. Friend ordered, then after stepping to side for me to order kitchen yells they are out of that bread. I ordered. We sat to wait on to go orders. My coaster goes off and I go up. They ""cleared"" my order, but did not have ready. They told me to ""sit down and wait"", that was rude. Could have said would you please or give us a minute. Glad my local Panera does not act like this!!!!!"
"41","Where to begin with this Panera location! Oh my. I love Panera and go there often for lunch, coffee, and for a place to study. I'm usually very satisfied with my meal and service, even though I think that the company overprices their items. However, my family and I had a HORRIBLE experience at this location. We went there for lunch, and the restaurant was mostly full with students studying. The only table open was one close to the back near the bathrooms. Typically, this wouldn't be issue, but at this location, it was. My father went into the men's bathroom and commented that it was the grossest bathroom he had ever seen in his life. We told one of the workers about the bathroom, and she proceeded to prop the men's door open to clean it. Given that we were at the table by the bathroom, the smell was horrendous and making all of us gag. My mother then asked the worker to close the door because we were going to be eating, and she rolled her eyes and didn't do it. At this point, we were already having a horrible experience, so we called the manager over. We told her what was happening, and she couldn't care less. She offered no help, and the bathroom door STILL was not closed. After all this, we received our food. I had ordered a full caesar salad and cup of soup. There were about two chopped pieces of romaine lettuce in my salad, and my cup of soup was half full. Once again, we called the manager over to ask about the portions, and she said she was ""just the manager"" and couldn't do anything about it. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION! Rude, inconsiderate workers who don't care that customers are paying $50 for a lunch for 3 people."
"42","For $6 to get all of the pizza you can eat. You can have any kind of pizza you can dream up using the toppings they have. That being said it's not really quality your getting here, just quantity, as much quantity as you want."
"43","Wow this was the dirtiest pizza restaurant I've ever stepped into in my life we had to clean the table off with hand sanitizer and paper towels from the bathroom the the booster seat for the baby was so dirty my wife use paper towels and sanitizer to clean it off and it came out black one of the employees bumped into my son and almost knocked him flat didn't say a word didn't even look over and acknowledging just kept on walking this restaurant is a joke and I'll complain to the manager did give us our money back but it was a horrific experience I will never under any circumstances return to that restaurant one of the clean dishes from the buffet line already had lettuce stuck to it"
"44","If you have never been to a CiCis Pizza, it is an all you can eat pizza buffet. I started going to others when I was a little kid, however, more recently their entire business model has changed to ""5 dollars and change"" - the total cost was $5.99. I also purchased a drink, but if you download the app and register, you get a free drink! They have one long buffet with several areas - first the salad bar, which had several different types of veggies and dressings. I did not find any cheese the first time I went, but then I saw that they were in individual containers. There was also a very delicious pasta salad which tasted like Italian dressing. The second ""section"" was the soup and pasta section which included pasta with the choice of either marinara or a white sauce. I had the marinara and it tasted great. The third section had several types of pizza - I had the pepperoni, the New York Style Pepperoni/Sausage, buffalo chicken, and then the deep dish (which I did not like much). I had to say, my favorite was the New York Style, but the others were equally as good. The sauce is a sweeter sauce, which personally I like for my pizza, and I love buffalo chicken pizza, but this one was really dry. One thing that I saw is if you do not like something that is on their bar, you are able to order your own pizza. I personally did not, however, it is an option, and there is a piece of paper for you to go and order from, and then they give you a beeper once it is done. The last section is by far my favorite, and that is their dessert. They are known for their cinnamon rolls which are melt in your mouth delicious.  They also had an apple pie dessert pizza, and from my understanding, it was delicious. Also - the drinks are self serve; it is right by the end of the buffet. There is also an option to purchase chicken wings (they are not included) - but, it's an all you can eat buffet, so unless you NEED chicken wings, it's kind of a waste. If you do not want to eat there, you can always pick up pizza to go, and the prices seemed like what you would pay at a Dominos pizza. Another nice feature of the restaurant is that there is an arcade there with traditional arcade games. Good touch for the kids!Finally - to the reason they got 3 stars, and not 5. The restaurant is gross. The floors were so sticky and the staff does not know how to clean up very well - the entire time I was there, there was a slice of pizza on the floor. Nobody in my party wanted to use the bathroom there because of how gross the place was. The staff was not that attentive either, which you need to be because it is a buffet. Another little thing - there were no plates by the salad, even though the salad was first on the buffet line... The food was great - for $6, it is a great deal, however, the place is very dirty and sticky. I know I will be sending a message to corporate so then they know because that is how bad it was. If you bring your kids, make sure you bring wipes to wipe everything down."
"45","If I could give this place zero stars I would. First, the place is disgustingly dirty. Your feet literally stick to the floor when you walk. I would love to see some sort of health inspection because there is no way it is up to code. Second, the food is below average. I've been to different locations where the food was much better. Do yourself a favor and order Pizza Hut."
"46","good food , sloppy unfriendly service. I just can't recommend eating here. get it to go. staff is unsmiling, and unfriendly"
"47","Stopped in to DiBella's with wife, mom, and son yesterday for a quick Valentine's Day lunch.  I ordered a medium Philly Cheesesteak, my son got a turkey and cheese, my mom ordered a Godfather, and my wife ordered a Buffalo chicken sandwich.  We paid, grabbed our chips and drinks, and then sat down with our numbers so the waitresses could see them.  They build your sammich and then hunt around the restaurant looking for your number.  When they see your number they give you the sammich and you can begin your indulgence.  DiBella's subs are larger than most sub shops because they give you almost twice the bread as other sub shops.  I'm really not a fan of all the bread, but it is fresh baked and very tasty.  I ordered my cheesesteak on 'everthing' bread, which had a great taste.The quality of the steak used on the sandwich was very good.  I tasted the meat by itself and it had a good texture and a great taste.  The rest of the sandwich was delicious.  I loved it.  It was almost too big to eat at one sitting.  The large sandwiches - don't even go there and less you want to share one amongst two or three people.  I tasted my wife's Buffalo chicken and it was also delicious.  My mom gave me a bite of her Godfather and that was really tasty too.  My son's small turkey sub was too much for him to polish off, but he made every attempt.  Excellent subs!"
"48","The 1 star represents the service not the food.  Came in at 3 pm in the afternoon and nobody was in there.  Two people behind the counter socializing and didn't even acknowledge we were there until 10 minutes of standing there.  By the way we were only a foot away from them and said they would be with us soon while doing nothing.  Took our order by asking ""what do you want"".  Only ordered two subs and my wife's sub she said no olives and don't toast it in which the ignored both requests.  Took there good old time making it.Only writing this because we love the food and hope service gets better so they can last.  We know the chipotle down the street had to fire rehire everyone and start from scratch because of service issues.  Looks to be a trend."
"49","Loved this place when it first opened! There was an Asian guy that was the manager, perhaps he was a store launcher, things were awesome but have progressively gone down hill since... We just left there & went to Steak & Shake because the Shanghai steak I always get looked like it had been sitting there 2 hours... we went at 2pm, so I get how that could have happened...I also understand it seems they're doing what they need to to save money but I don't know if I'll take my chances going there... there has to be a a better happy medium to having the food I want to order and not breaking the bank... I gladly pay the premium price & would pay extra if they use asparagus in the recipe again"
"50","They have decent food but I definitely consider it expensive for the quality you're getting. I've also noticed on multiple visits that none of the employees ever wear gloves-- like they all serve and cook the food bare handed."
"51","Well, my first visit to Panda Express ever was a mixed bag of feelings/emotions. In fact, i haven't written a Yelp review in a while but I felt the need to say something...First, the food was good. In fact, it was better than I expected it to be. I tried 3 entrees (SweetFire Chicken Breast, Beijing Beef and Black Pepper Chicken) and none was bad. In fact, i would gladly eat these dishes again.The main problem was the management. I walked in and there was a line - not long, but getting there. There were people waiting for food while others were walking past them with their dishes to pay. When I got to give my order I started to let the girl there know what I wanted when the manager (i'm guessing) came and pulled her from the line while I was talking. So, she just walked away. I came to understand that she'd been doing this for a while and this was why others were waiting for their food and while others left without their food - clearly pissed off. In addition to this, they were running out of obvious things like fired rice which they should consider making in bulk to be quickly reheated. So, they're running out of food asking customers to wait and then pulling the employees who were creating those customers' dishes leaving them to be forgotten. It's gonna need to be improved considerably. I'd give the food 4 stars but the service was a 0-1 star experience."
"52","Commercial Chinese. It's expensive for what you get and everything tastes the same. They do have a good chow mein though (actually lo mein but whatever). The people working there are always very unprofessional and have no problem carrying on a conversation between themselves even if they are helping you. Nearly 8 dollars for a 2 item combo with barely any food compared to a local run place is totally unacceptable. Seriously, unless you're in a huge rush, and don't have a problem spending way more for food than it's worth, just go to a locally run American Chinese food joint instead, they are worth the wait and the price. Unlike Panda Express."
"53","Food is ok, but they are incredibly understaffed and service is very slow. Wanted to get in and out quickly so I ordered online. It said it would take 15 minutes I ended up waiting 45 minutes no exaggeration. Probably not gonna come back to this location"
"54","Been here a few times already. Pretty decent Chinese food, no real complaints there. OnlyIssue that brings this rating down is their drive-thru. There was never a time I went to this specific location and waited less than 20 min in the drive thru. Just got back from a 30 min wait and it was rather frustrating. Just don't understand it. I feel like they make smaller portions of food and don't make anymore when it runs low? Idk. If they fix this issue, it's an easy 4/5"
"55","Stopped in for a quick bite after a recent volleyball game. It was 8pm, which is late for us to eat dinner. We didn't want to start cooking at that time, so to Panda Express we went.Upon arrival, there was a short line due to the staff working slowly. There were six employees present, three of them were eating in the dining room, one was handling the drive through, one was cooking, and one was taking dine in orders. Within a few minutes, we were selecting our entrees to go.I ordered Kung Pao chicken over chow mein noodles bowl. My son ordered orange chicken over white rice bowl. My daughter ordered a orange chicken and peanut chicken with fried rice plate. My wife ordered a teriyaki chicken over white rice bowl. We paid $25 and the orders were made and taken to go. This was a very good price to feed four of us, especially when we're used to paying a minimum of $35 for a meal for four.All the way home, the food smelled great in the car! We barely got into the kitchen before we attacked the Chinese goodness. My son took a bite and then ran to the trash to spit it out. He is very sensitive to spicy food. His orange chicken was spicy. I tasted it and it did have a bit of a kick, surprisingly. I then tasted my wife's teriyaki chicken, which had no spice at all. I asked if she could switch with my son, so he could eat something. They switched and he hesitated to eat the teriyaki chicken, but within a few minutes, he made the new dish disappear. My wife said in disappointment, ""...but I wanted teriyaki chicken!""My Kung Pao chicken had a nice kick to it. I didn't like the whole chili peppers in the dish because they're hard to chew. However, they looked nice and I simply tossed them out. The chow mein noodles were also tasty and paired well with the Kung Pao. The bowl was a nice portion. Of course, I could eat more, but I'm trying to reduce my overall mass.I tasted the teriyaki chicken, the orange chicken, and the peanut chicken too. All the food was tasty, if not spicy, save for the teriyaki chicken. The price was right and they have a drive through. We would eat here again. Good stuff."
"56","If you like waiting 10 minutes to order, never being able to get what you wanted, and getting inconsistent portions this is the place for you. The food it good but the service is just awful. I just walked out because they did not have rice of any kind. Will not return to this location"
"57","We've been here a handful of times since they opened. I'm excited to report they've finally stopped over cooking(burning) most of the food. But unfortunately their broccoli to beef ratio has gone up & now there is barely any beef in The broccoli beef now.I'm not ready to give up hope just yet & we'll be back soon. Fingers crossed they keep getting better & they don't fail us!"
