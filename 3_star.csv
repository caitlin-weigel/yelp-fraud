"1","The food here is really, really good. The service here is really, really slow. The buffalo wrap is delicious. The sandwiches here are great. The Quarter Pound Burger I thought was the best deal in town until this past week.I developed a bad case of food poisoning after eating here.I did notice that the burger I ordered had mushrooms that were not entirely cooked although I didn't say anything because I was hungry.  The virus itself can be caused by bad meat or produce, not washing lettuce and vegetables thoroughly.I have noticed some bad habits by the servers over the years here as well. Trays stacked with dirty dishes that are left out in the dining room, or the counter that sneezes when shes counting your money and hands it back to you.Inn on Coventry and big Als are preferable breakfast places. There's also a place called Michael's Diner on the square thats not bad."
"2","Though I love the Chagrin location of Your's Truly, I am sad to say I was disappointed in the Shaker Square location. The food was still up to par however the service left much to be desired. Multiple times throughout the meal, my friends and I genuinely thought our waitress forgot about us... I will still most likely come back because I love the food and the variety they offer but I may either stick with the Chagrin location or opt for takeout."
"3","Good food with generous servings. Gave it 3 stars due to service being a bit slow. Took 10-15 minutes to get have waitress acknowledge us. Food was hot and fresh when it arrived. Lots of Cleveland police officers eating there so we felt very safe ."
"4","Good food, bad service. Glass of Dr. Pepper $2.50 and a small glass.  Sausage and eggs very good!"
"5","The food was basic breakfast diner type food.  The pancakes were good simple.  The staff was very patient and accomodating.  I didn't find the food memorable and much prefer Fire next door but this diner is good for casual breakfast and is kid friendly.  It doesn't have the food quality or ambiance of its neighbor but if you just want comfort food on a weekend morning and want to stay in sweats this a decent choice."
"6","This was a very nice brunch. The waiter was very quick and efficient. The atmosphere was very inviting and the food was delicious and filling. The 1star short of awesome was the silverware had some food stuck on it and that was a concern for me."
"7","I love YT restaurants in general but after the experience I had last night at this branch, I will not go back until the manager that worked last night is fired. I specifically asked about a certain dish based on the photo in the menu. I needed to know because my gut will have major problems if I have gluten. I was assured by the waiter that it was not battered. What came out was was battered chicken fingers and not the chicken wings I ordered. I was then told that they didn't have chicken wings and walked away without asking me if I wanted anything else. We had already waited 20 or so min for the food to be delivered after ordering and the sandwich I ordered (with gluten free bread) to go with the wings was already only luke warm by that point. I ate the sandwich. The waiter returned when I was halfway done with the sandwich and then asked if I wanted anything instead. By that time i wasn't about to wait another 20 min for another entree. The waiter was very nice and simply made a mistake. I was willing to let this all go but then this happened. The waiter came by with this electronic pad for payment. When I went to select my tip, I noticed the tip amounts were dollars more than what the tip percentages should have been. I pointed it out to the waiter and he was surprised and went to get the manager. The manager came over and said ""what's the problem here?""  I thought the waiter would have told him about the tip percentages being wrong. I showed him my bill and told him that a 20% tip based on my bill would be x amount. And then showed him the device and the tip amount it shows for 20%. Much more. He grumbled words I didn't understand and took the device and started punching stuff in it. I asked him if it was basing the tip amounts on the original figure from before they took off the chicken wings. He looked at me and said we don't sell them here. I told him that I had specifically asked about them and was assured that you did and that nothing was battered because of the gluten intolerance. He wouldn't even look at me and he kept doing stuff with the device. Then he put the device in front of me and said type in what you want to give for a tip. I typed in $3. He said to me, ""is that all?"" I said that's more than 20% but he puts my new receipt down with the tip added into the original amount and no pen to sign, turned around and walked away as fast as possible. Next thing I know, I get an alert on my phone as I always do when I'm at a restaurant or store and purchase something. The amount is $4+ more than the total with the tip. Normally it goes through initially for the amount without the tip and the tip shows up during final processing. I couldn't believe his treatment of me to start with but this was too much. I brought my receipts and phone up to him at the register and asked him why he charged me over $4 more than my total with tip. He said he charged me correctly. I said that my bank charge says otherwise and try to show him. He refuses to look at it and said that he put it in correctly and nothing went through yet. I said it obviously did go through because it's already been charged to my account. He said the correct amount will show up at 4:30 am when the bulk processing happens. I asked him how the wrong amount showed up on my account if he put in the correct amount. He just said the correct amount will show up at 4:30 am. At this point, there was no point in discussing the matter with him any further. I told him it had better be correct and that this has been the worst experience. He never looked at me or apologized.  Mind you, this morning the amount on my bank is still incorrect. This manager has committed fraud and is one of the worst restaurant managers ever. I tend to tip 20-30% based on service. Despite the error the waiter made he was still a good waiter in every other way. His tip was more than 25% based on the total. However, charging me an additional $4+ for what, I don't know, was fraud and that I will not tolerate on any level."
"8","If you head to Cleveland, stop at what I consider one of the best breakfast places in town. I grew up on Yours Truly food in places like Chagrin Blvd's iconic, small location and Chagrin Falls. This morning I had a their very standard scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon and rye bread and everything was done to perfection. They just get breakfast right. Good, strong coffee, well done hash browns and crispy bacon. The Shaker Circle location is a place where everyone knows your name or they're trying to recall it. Parking is the only downside because it is mostly metered if you drive there, so have plenty of quarters handy!"
"9","I've been to Lake Orion, Mi and Rochester, Mi locations once each and had an excellent time at both.  I'd give 5 stars except the following experience. This was the location in Beachwood, Ohio. Food was yummy. Service varied from ignorant to ok. We, a friend, myself and my toddler, entered with a couple in front of us.  We stood there for several minutes. A man who appeared to be the manager returned twice to the hostess, each time having a long conversation about seating. The restaurant was basically empty. The hostess never even looked at us. Finally, during the second conversation I interrupted to say how long we'd waited and could they seat us. The hostess mumbled something about thinking we were with a group. I really hate having to get pushy to get a normal level of service. After that the service from the waitress was acceptable.  She was definitely struggling to serve a pretty slow section. The hostess and carry out staff continued to carry on conversations instead of doing some work.  Management at this location needs to step it up with hiring. The staff was really low quality for this kind of place."
"10","They allow the Mom's to bring their kids to the bar???? I guess if you say something it would be worse, smh."
"11","We stopped here after getting our nails done and I think it was a wonderful idea!!!!  I was starving!Our waiter, Steven, was extremely good at his job.  He was very on top of attending to our table and suggesting what to eat.  He also was very friendly and joked with us at the table.  He for sure is one of the main reasons why I am giving this BW3s all THE stars!  So if corporate ever reads this, Steven is a rock star and deserves all the gold stars!!!For my appetizer I ordered chips and salsa.  And I LOVE me some chips and salsa.  Their salsa had an extra kick to it, which I truly appreciated!  For my main course I ordered the veggie burger without cheese and added the Asian Zing (I forgot the name of it lol).  It was so yummy, very spicy but oh so good!"
"12","needed to grab some dinner and what are the odds we come on .70 boneless wing night.  ordered 3 types  a hot BBQ , Asian Zing and Medium  they had great flavor and the wings nice and crispy. we shared a basket of Buffalo Chips and appreciated that did not come salted. we had fun dipping into the sauces and I tried to be good with a garden salad with tomatoes and cucumbers and red peppers shaved Parmesean and my choice of dressing on the side. our waiter came around just enough to make sure we were fine and brought plenty of hand wipes and napkins"

"14","This place rocks! The food is always delicious and we love using the enclosed patio to host business events."
"15","This place has perfected the crispiness of chicken wings even though it's smothered in different flavors. Came here with friends and ordered a BWW Big Jack Daddy Burger. The sauce wasn't enough and the bun was chewy, although the fries were good. Will be sticking to their wings from now on, whether out of town or back home."
"16","Let's start with the housekeeping isn't the greatest.  My waitress then punched in my order wrong.  Finally got that corrected.  They only carry the pink sweetener.  When my new wings come out one is the wrong dry rub.  I've been waiting for about 10 minutes now.  We had to ask three times for napkins. My coworker and I ordered carrots and celery.  Had to ask for those 4 times.  When the manager dropped them off he just put them on the table and walked away.  My waitress just came to my table and asked if I wanted the bill.  No.  I want my freaking wings.  This place is a disaster and should be avoided at all costs."
"17","I've had good and bad service here. Four minute wait time to get to a table to take a drink order is not acceptable. Not when there's 7 servers on the floor and 6 tables of people in the whole restaurant. Not in my opinion. At least greet them to let them know your alive. When I worked Olive Garden we had a 30 second greeting. Not here but I'm one for screening employees before you hire them: math test, reading test, reasoning, time them on how fast they can fill out a job app. Food is pretty good I guess. I like the Thursday wing special. Beer prices are fair. Plan on spending 20 bucks a person here. Most recent visit:  The host was high as a kite. Took him 5 minutes of him looking at us to connect dots and realize he ought to seat us. He walked 5 steps and gave us the nearest booth. We saw our server three times in the two hours we were there. Drink ticket times were 20 minutes. Our drink order, iced tea, was repeatedly wrong.  We wanted more food and drinks but we weren't willing to wait 45 more minutes to get more items so we cashed out and left. Badly understaffed. Parking is tough. Nice location. Take the other reviewers reviews seriously. There's truth somewhere in the middle. Always."
"18","They get 2 stars instead of 1 because they have lots of TVs for watching games, but wow the service here is unbearably slow.What motivated me to write this review is that I had three Guinesses over the course of the game and each time they came out looking like the photo -- a ridiculous amount of foam. The bartender was clearly never instructed on how to pour, dump the foam, wait and poor again. It's a rudimentary skill that all bartenders quickly grasp, but not here."
"19","The service is always poor and the servants like talking to a person but not checking other customers."
"20","We waited for over 40 mins for the wings when there were only a few people there. The wings tastes ok. Neither great nor bad. The price is 60 cents per wing on Tuesdays, which is pretty good.Prepare to wait longer than you expected."
"21","DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! I came to celebrate my sister's graduation and the service here was terrible. Our table of 5 waited 15 minutes for our fountain drinks alone. We waited another 20+ minutes for an appetizer and when we asked the waitress for silverware she brought us plastic utinsils. After waiting a while longer for the food our waitress shared with the table there was a mix up with our orders and that our ticket was lost. We were at the establishment for over 50 minutes with only an appitizer and no refills on our drinks. We ended up leaving hungry  after talking to the manager. This place would be getting 1 star, but their manger showed his concern with our disappointment and made an effort to turn the night around. Nevertheless, I would not recommend."
"22","Update on my previous review. It's hard for me to knock a rating down, but the service is just...something else. I love me some chicken wings and their potato wedges, but it's not really possible to go in for a quick meal. Maybe that is why their takeout is so popular. I'd still come to Bdubs, but just plan your time accordingly."
"23","It is Olive Garden.  They are consistent with food.  The thing they do really well is their lunch.  Soup, salad and bread sticks.  I love their soups.  Great price.Their dinners are okay as well.  Not great, but consistent and a great price.  Service is good.  Last trip in some folks did not show for their shift.  They adjusted well, but it actually took some time for them to figure out how to seat folks.  It was odd.  In the end, it all worked out."
"24","A standard panera. Place is not the cleanest. Two floors, lots of tables, good for groups and studying."
"25","I love Panera and I go to college nearby, so I find myself coming here occasionally. Unfortunately, the service is terrible. My order is either wrong or they forget it completely. Moreover, the Mediterranean veggie sandwich I usually get at other Paneras is way smaller in size at this location - totally not worth the $7. If you're hungry, you'd probably be better off going to the chipotle next door."
"26","Wanted some pastries and to see that they were covered in flies/nats  I brought it to the attention of the manager Stacy and she said there was nothing she could do about it.  Notice the pics with the flies!"
"27","This is the worst panera establishment I have ever been to. They mess up your order 40% of the time and the customer service is horrendous. Drive to Sweet Melissa's or The Fix for soup and sandwiches. The worst part is the servers get very defensive when asking questions about items they end up messing up."

"29","My wife ordered (online) chicken noodle soup and a whole baguette, and a Greek salad for me.My meal should have come with bread... but they left it out.  The Greek salad was awful. Almost no olives and almost no feta. And the left out all the bread.I went back... for the bread and they still shortchanged us... the one piece that should have come with my terrible Greek salad.  The manager apologized without even looking at me.Terrible place. They simply seem not to care.  The manager was the one who looked at the online order and still got it wrong. If you go there best to check every item before leaving.  Lots of other alternatives. Panera... are you listening?"
"30","If you have never been to a CiCis Pizza, it is an all you can eat pizza buffet. I started going to others when I was a little kid, however, more recently their entire business model has changed to ""5 dollars and change"" - the total cost was $5.99. I also purchased a drink, but if you download the app and register, you get a free drink! They have one long buffet with several areas - first the salad bar, which had several different types of veggies and dressings. I did not find any cheese the first time I went, but then I saw that they were in individual containers. There was also a very delicious pasta salad which tasted like Italian dressing. The second ""section"" was the soup and pasta section which included pasta with the choice of either marinara or a white sauce. I had the marinara and it tasted great. The third section had several types of pizza - I had the pepperoni, the New York Style Pepperoni/Sausage, buffalo chicken, and then the deep dish (which I did not like much). I had to say, my favorite was the New York Style, but the others were equally as good. The sauce is a sweeter sauce, which personally I like for my pizza, and I love buffalo chicken pizza, but this one was really dry. One thing that I saw is if you do not like something that is on their bar, you are able to order your own pizza. I personally did not, however, it is an option, and there is a piece of paper for you to go and order from, and then they give you a beeper once it is done. The last section is by far my favorite, and that is their dessert. They are known for their cinnamon rolls which are melt in your mouth delicious.  They also had an apple pie dessert pizza, and from my understanding, it was delicious. Also - the drinks are self serve; it is right by the end of the buffet. There is also an option to purchase chicken wings (they are not included) - but, it's an all you can eat buffet, so unless you NEED chicken wings, it's kind of a waste. If you do not want to eat there, you can always pick up pizza to go, and the prices seemed like what you would pay at a Dominos pizza. Another nice feature of the restaurant is that there is an arcade there with traditional arcade games. Good touch for the kids!Finally - to the reason they got 3 stars, and not 5. The restaurant is gross. The floors were so sticky and the staff does not know how to clean up very well - the entire time I was there, there was a slice of pizza on the floor. Nobody in my party wanted to use the bathroom there because of how gross the place was. The staff was not that attentive either, which you need to be because it is a buffet. Another little thing - there were no plates by the salad, even though the salad was first on the buffet line... The food was great - for $6, it is a great deal, however, the place is very dirty and sticky. I know I will be sending a message to corporate so then they know because that is how bad it was. If you bring your kids, make sure you bring wipes to wipe everything down."
"31","Took the kids to Cici's recently and we enjoyed the $5.00 pizza buffet.  They had some tasty pizzas and some not-so-tasty pizzas.  The stuffed crust pizzas were really good.  My favorite was the stuffed pretzel crust pizza.  It tasted good, was fresh, and had a yummy filling.  You can't beat the price.  Plus, my kids are picky, but Cici's has a pizza for every pallet. Free refills on drinks is always a good thing.We'll probably visit again."
"32","This place is DISGUSTING !!!! My shoes stuck to the floor , the tables and chairs were maybe only dusted off and everything was just nasty. Even the windows weren't clean. Not sure if it had anything to do with the older woman that busses the place but please get new help. The food was good , the salad could be fresher it was only noon. My silverware and dishes were clean I can say that and my pizza was edible. The other reviews are not lying , skip this place is you want to dine in cleanliness."
"33","Let's face it Cici's is far from gourmet pizza. What is nice about the buffet here is the diverse array of options on the buffet at any given moment. If you like pepperoni... there is a pepperoni... if you like vegy... there is a vegy... this is definitely good value for the money."

"35","Not clean. Floor counters employees So much diversity in pizza choices there was none. When I ask if I could order one for the table something that usually they bring out immediately - I was told it would be a 45 minute wait. Really?"
"36","Chains can only star so high in my life, because they can only be so good (or bad!). This location gets good enough marks. Dibella's is like Subway with better bread. Their small is actually twice the size of what I thought it would be. But they are not going to replace other sandwich shops for me. They really go light on the fillings unfortunately. I actually had to take half the bread away because it was just a horrible ratio of tuna to bread."
"37","I'm in love with these subs! I get the Veggie with everything except olives. It was like a party in my mouth!The small had to be at least 7"". I almost couldn't finish, but pushed on because it was so delicious.Take a minute and join Club Bread. I received a small sub for free. This would likely become my sub establishment of choice if it were closer to home.Great food and great service."
"38","This Dibellas sucks monkey ass literally! They can't comprehend your order correctly then have attitudes bc they fcked up! Never again ! Ain't no starts bihhh"
"39","Stopped in for a quick bite after a recent volleyball game. It was 8pm, which is late for us to eat dinner. We didn't want to start cooking at that time, so to Panda Express we went.Upon arrival, there was a short line due to the staff working slowly. There were six employees present, three of them were eating in the dining room, one was handling the drive through, one was cooking, and one was taking dine in orders. Within a few minutes, we were selecting our entrees to go.I ordered Kung Pao chicken over chow mein noodles bowl. My son ordered orange chicken over white rice bowl. My daughter ordered a orange chicken and peanut chicken with fried rice plate. My wife ordered a teriyaki chicken over white rice bowl. We paid $25 and the orders were made and taken to go. This was a very good price to feed four of us, especially when we're used to paying a minimum of $35 for a meal for four.All the way home, the food smelled great in the car! We barely got into the kitchen before we attacked the Chinese goodness. My son took a bite and then ran to the trash to spit it out. He is very sensitive to spicy food. His orange chicken was spicy. I tasted it and it did have a bit of a kick, surprisingly. I then tasted my wife's teriyaki chicken, which had no spice at all. I asked if she could switch with my son, so he could eat something. They switched and he hesitated to eat the teriyaki chicken, but within a few minutes, he made the new dish disappear. My wife said in disappointment, ""...but I wanted teriyaki chicken!""My Kung Pao chicken had a nice kick to it. I didn't like the whole chili peppers in the dish because they're hard to chew. However, they looked nice and I simply tossed them out. The chow mein noodles were also tasty and paired well with the Kung Pao. The bowl was a nice portion. Of course, I could eat more, but I'm trying to reduce my overall mass.I tasted the teriyaki chicken, the orange chicken, and the peanut chicken too. All the food was tasty, if not spicy, save for the teriyaki chicken. The price was right and they have a drive through. We would eat here again. Good stuff."
"40","Yum!A bit too much cabbage in the chow meinThe fried rice is delicious (I love the soy sauce)We have eaten here several times and it has been good every time"
"41","We've been here a handful of times since they opened. I'm excited to report they've finally stopped over cooking(burning) most of the food. But unfortunately their broccoli to beef ratio has gone up & now there is barely any beef in The broccoli beef now.I'm not ready to give up hope just yet & we'll be back soon. Fingers crossed they keep getting better & they don't fail us!"
"42","Well just average. Chow mein was dry very very dry I'd say stick to the rice. Tried a beef option and of course the orange chicken because well it's panda express. Both were dry, not as dry as the chow mein but was just expecting better. Nothing I'm running back for or probably will ever go back to. I'll take my 15 dollars to the mom and pop Chinese place."
"43","Was excited to try Panda Express, ordered online for pickup. Got there 8 minutes past pickup time waited almost 15 minutes before someone helped me and two other guest for pickup. They were busy but not overwhelming. Overall I got the firecracker chicken with orange chicken and fried rice. The meal itself was okay.I would try again."
"44","I got a coupon and it said a free plate when you buy one it didn't include sides a thought a plate was everything and the free food with coupon they gave me was like 4 pieces of orange chicken not enough to feed a 2 year old a sample they should of stated on coupon it was a sample and the food was bland bad no taste or maybe it taste kinda like card board this place isn't all that great unless your starving and its the only place close to you the cost is also high for the quality of the food its like generic Chinese made by teens not saying teens can't cook but they lack experience they are great cooks when you want pizza rolls lol well the manager did get back to my review fast that's great so service is good so this place is not all bad and its new so maybe I will try it again"
"45","I'm shocked this location has anything higher than a 1 star rating. The staff is the rudest I have ever encountered in the food service industry by far. I've tried on a few occasions to "" give them one more chance "" and I just can't get past the blatant attitudes and sub par food. If you want decent Chinese food, go some place else because you're not getting it here sadly."
"46","Well, my first visit to Panda Express ever was a mixed bag of feelings/emotions. In fact, i haven't written a Yelp review in a while but I felt the need to say something...First, the food was good. In fact, it was better than I expected it to be. I tried 3 entrees (SweetFire Chicken Breast, Beijing Beef and Black Pepper Chicken) and none was bad. In fact, i would gladly eat these dishes again.The main problem was the management. I walked in and there was a line - not long, but getting there. There were people waiting for food while others were walking past them with their dishes to pay. When I got to give my order I started to let the girl there know what I wanted when the manager (i'm guessing) came and pulled her from the line while I was talking. So, she just walked away. I came to understand that she'd been doing this for a while and this was why others were waiting for their food and while others left without their food - clearly pissed off. In addition to this, they were running out of obvious things like fired rice which they should consider making in bulk to be quickly reheated. So, they're running out of food asking customers to wait and then pulling the employees who were creating those customers' dishes leaving them to be forgotten. It's gonna need to be improved considerably. I'd give the food 4 stars but the service was a 0-1 star experience."
"47","I grew up on the Gulf Coast and I miss the crawfish boils and delicious, well-seasoned seafood. After basically giving up on finding good Cajun food in Cleveland, particularly crawfish, I am so happy that this place has opened.Went there on 7/7/17, and they said they've been open for a couple weeks. They're clearly still figuring things out. Our waitress let us know that they're still seeing what's popular before they put together combo meals, and that one of the mixed drinks wasn't being made anymore because it hadn't gotten a good reception. I thought the food was hands-down delicious, and I appreciate them being critical enough of themselves to be in a period of morphing their menu toward what the customer enjoys.Their format now is you choose your seafood by the pound, a sauce, a spiciness level, and any sides. It all gets cooked in a bag to make a big bag of deliciousness. We got shrimp, mussels, crawfish, corn, and potatoes with hot bomb diggity sauce. Definitely a delicious and fun meal. Overall, the experience, service, food, and drinks were all great. Can't wait go to back."
"48","I visited this restaurant on a Friday evening with my boyfriend and we both had a wonderful experience. The staff was very attentive and we were immediately sat. We chose to sit at the bar and our bartender was very personable and made us both the wonderful capri sun style drinks. We ordered calamari, the crab legs, sausage and shrimp. The sausage was AMAZING as were the crab legs. You get a good amount of food relative to price. The place is clean, well lit, and has great decor. I think it is in a great location and a rare restaurant in Cleveland. I would definitely go back! If you had a bad experience, give the place a chance, all new restaurants go through ups and downs but Cleveland deserves a boiling seafood restaurant!"
"49","We got a pound of clams and some sides. The clams were covered in a delicious sauce (the third option, forget what it's called). Unfortunately, many of the shells were empty. Upon complaining we received excellent service- drinks on the house and beautiful conversation with the cook, Team Ny  (his real name -- ask him about it.) Stop in, it's a comfortable place with innovative food. (But maybe avoid the clams, hah)"
