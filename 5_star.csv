"1","Great place for breakfast...love M @ M Omlets! And corned beef hash!"
"2","The food was absolutely delicious! That was my first time visiting. My boyfriend and I both had the Killit Skillit and Belgian waffles. I didn't think I could finish all that food, but I did. The service was excellent as well. I'll definitely be back to visit."
"3","Fantastic food. Also, I got a lemon for my water and it was unnecessarily fresh. I got my hand drenched from squeezing it."
"4","When I visit Cleveland, this is my first stop to get some Notso Fries (no words to describe its greatness) and Chicken Fingers with that awesome honey mustard sauce! And I hate honey mustard sauce! The Special Delivery is great too and you get so much. My sister gets the milkshakes and they are huge and they leave the mixing cup with whatever won't fit in your glass. I love Yours Truly and miss it when I'm away."
"5","I really had a good breakfast there! I'll be back to dine there the next time I'm in n Cleveland, Ohio"
"6","The food was absolutely delicious! That was my first time visiting. My boyfriend and I both had the Killit Skillit and Belgian waffles. I didn't think I could finish all that food, but I did. The service was excellent as well. I'll definitely be back to visit."
"7","The food here is really, really good. The service here is really, really slow. The buffalo wrap is delicious. The sandwiches here are great. The Quarter Pound Burger I thought was the best deal in town until this past week.I developed a bad case of food poisoning after eating here.I did notice that the burger I ordered had mushrooms that were not entirely cooked although I didn't say anything because I was hungry.  The virus itself can be caused by bad meat or produce, not washing lettuce and vegetables thoroughly.I have noticed some bad habits by the servers over the years here as well. Trays stacked with dirty dishes that are left out in the dining room, or the counter that sneezes when shes counting your money and hands it back to you.Inn on Coventry and big Als are preferable breakfast places. There's also a place called Michael's Diner on the square thats not bad."
"8","My colleague and I grab wings from here once a month around 1 and I have no major complaints. There is usually (when we visit) only a few people dining in but the service is still somewhat slow. However, the food is hot and good so I'll take that over slow and cold any day. The staff is nice and one of the cooks introduced me to the salt n vinegar rub wings...surprisingly good."
"9","This place rocks! The food is always delicious and we love using the enclosed patio to host business events."
"10","This place has perfected the crispiness of chicken wings even though it's smothered in different flavors. Came here with friends and ordered a BWW Big Jack Daddy Burger. The sauce wasn't enough and the bun was chewy, although the fries were good. Will be sticking to their wings from now on, whether out of town or back home."
"11","Always eat at the bar you'll get better service and your food will come out in time. You have to pick and choose the time you come here anytime in the evening is a No as the crowd gets rowdy and the servers disappear in the back chit chatting. It's very clear that management has a type of server they like to hire young pretty with attitude and no customer service training. Maybe if they focused more on customer service they would attract a more mature crowd and they could make more of a profit on big sporting events such as boxing and UFC events. This is one of the only BW3 that doesn't order these PPV events because of the crowd it'll attract. Management definitely needs to pull it together."
"12","needed to grab some dinner and what are the odds we come on .70 boneless wing night.  ordered 3 types  a hot BBQ , Asian Zing and Medium  they had great flavor and the wings nice and crispy. we shared a basket of Buffalo Chips and appreciated that did not come salted. we had fun dipping into the sauces and I tried to be good with a garden salad with tomatoes and cucumbers and red peppers shaved Parmesean and my choice of dressing on the side. our waiter came around just enough to make sure we were fine and brought plenty of hand wipes and napkins"
"13","I usually like BWW but this place was bad. Pretty empty when we got there at 8pm, a couple of 8-10 people groups came in and there was still plenty of room. First sign of trouble, ""I'll have a ... IPA, draft"", comes back in a bit ""we are out of that"", ""I'll have the Dogfish 60 IPA"" (a pretty standard IPA), comes back in a bit ""we are out of that, how about a Stone IPA"", ""Sure"" I say, comes back in a bit ""we are out of that"", WTF? My wife orders coffee, ""we are out of creamer, we do have milk"", OK, whatever. Put in a order for wings, pretty simple, it's in their name, it took 1/2 an hour for them to show up. They would stop by every 5-10 minutes to see if we wanted a beer refill, no thanks, I'll finish my food and get out of here."
"14","Terrible! Check out the first picture in my profile of staff and management standing around watching tv! Shameful lazy! 1. Slow service 2. Cold food (wings covered in cold sauce) (burgers and fries cold) burgers dry thin party terrible! 3. MANAGEMENT AWFUL - the two hours we were stuck at this horrible location we watched management along with several other staff just stand at the entrance area watching varies sports on TV. No help to staff - never checked on any tables. Clearly not managing the food coming out of the kitchen. Just standing there watching TV. This is the second experience at this location and certainly the last. Place is not busy if you feel like sitting alone but that will not speed up service or quality of food. Corporate compare your revenues to that of other locations. I'm sure the numbers match this poor review."
"15","Go to Winking Lizard. Service was poor, food was lackluster. We had an order come out wrong (it was inputted incorrectly), and the server who delivered it tried to convince us it was right. We got another server to take the food back and put in the correct order. By the time the correct order came back, the rest of us were done.At any decent restaurant (e.g. Winking Lizard) a manager would volunteer to deal with this in some way - no charge for the food or comping one of the beers. I've been in this situation before, and I return to restaurants that do their best to right their wrongs. Instead, we were informed by the server that nothing could be done because we ate the food (that arrived 25 minutes late). The manager similarly argued that he couldn't do anything because we ate it. He ultimately agreed to a discount on the single food item, but he was surly about it - no one from the restaurant owned their mistake.In short, eat local, and keep these kind of chains that care more about the bottom line than their patrons out of our neighborhood. I suggest Winking Lizard."
"16","I've had good and bad service here. Four minute wait time to get to a table to take a drink order is not acceptable. Not when there's 7 servers on the floor and 6 tables of people in the whole restaurant. Not in my opinion. At least greet them to let them know your alive. When I worked Olive Garden we had a 30 second greeting. Not here but I'm one for screening employees before you hire them: math test, reading test, reasoning, time them on how fast they can fill out a job app. Food is pretty good I guess. I like the Thursday wing special. Beer prices are fair. Plan on spending 20 bucks a person here. Most recent visit:  The host was high as a kite. Took him 5 minutes of him looking at us to connect dots and realize he ought to seat us. He walked 5 steps and gave us the nearest booth. We saw our server three times in the two hours we were there. Drink ticket times were 20 minutes. Our drink order, iced tea, was repeatedly wrong.  We wanted more food and drinks but we weren't willing to wait 45 more minutes to get more items so we cashed out and left. Badly understaffed. Parking is tough. Nice location. Take the other reviewers reviews seriously. There's truth somewhere in the middle. Always."
"17","This is only my second time at this location and will be my last. On wing night they only had two servers and one was training another, servicing the entire place. It took 5-10 minutes just to be seated even with management walking past the line of us needing to be seated. It was quickly decided to order drinks and food together so we wouldn't have to wait forever. Thankfully the food was hot and came out fairly quick but no refills on drinks etc as again they were taking care of the whole restaurant. Not blaming the servers, I just believe that if management cared enough or focused on service this location wouldn't be such a terrible place."
"18","I had the Stuffed Chicken Marsala, its was very good. My companion had the Salmon Piccata, she was very happy with her meal.  The salad was also very good, fresh crispy lettuce, good tomatoes, and purple onion.  Our waiter, Mitch, was excellent.  He was efficient, pleasant and very accommodating.  He made our dining experience a joy.   We didn't have to wait for anything, maybe because we arrived just after five.  Get there between three and five to pick from a discounted menu.  We would go back. Ask for server  Mitch.  Very good job, thanks Mitch."
"19","I do not need to say anything,check the pictures say is all!!!! I am really upset!!! This panera needs a new manager for sure!!!"
"20","I went to Panera frequently (embarrassingly frequently) during my first two years of medical school in Pennsylvania.  Since I moved to Ohio, I haven't been here as often, partly because I'm burned out on it, and partly because there's better options in the neighborhood.  However, every once in a while a craving strikes and I make a visit.For whatever reason, this location does seem a lot slower than what I've been used to in the past.  This is especially problematic if you're trying to get a coffee and pastry to go in the morning.  Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had any problems with the employees being unfriendly or lazy, just not as quick as I'm accustomed to.  On the bright side, my to-go online orders have always been ready on time.  If you are planning on spending time to work or visit here, timeliness isn't as much of an issue, and then it's not such a bad location.  There are more outlets than I'm used to finding, WiFi works reliably, and the store itself is pretty clean.I may not be a regular here like I've been in the past, but it's not a bad spot to end up for lunch, especially if you're hungry for tomato soup."
"21","CiCi's pizza is awesome! It has a buffet of pizzas. Excellent soup and salad.Then it includes a delicious dessert, with brownie cake,  cinnamon buns, and apple pie pizza.Overall, CiCi's pizza should get 100 stars, from its quality of food."
"22","We decided to eat here after dropping someone off at the airport and heading back home.  The kids, for the most part, enjoyed the pizza; however, the reviews that compare this restaurant to a dumpster are not lying.  Even though the price is cheap, we still deserve a clean place to eat.  The restaurant is disturbingly disgusting.  The workers were mopping up messes, but the mop water smelled putrid. I felt so bad for taking my kids there. I will give the restaurant an extra star because the people that work there were friendly and doing their best to keep up with the throngs of people. Still, no other word but disgusting.  I made the kids take their shoes off even before getting into the car because the floor looked THAT disgusting."

"24","Went to cicis this past weekend and I  will no longer visit this particular location.Restrooms were nasty,the employees used to be outgoing and friendly now they act like rehearsed robots.Atmosphere has changed so much in the past month or so.The food was ok but not plentiful.I was a so pleased with my past visits but no longer now.Good bye Cicis at Ridgepark"
"25","Large sandwiches for the $$. However I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich with everything on it. When it arrived to my table and opened it, only meat. Nothing else. Very blah. They were too busy for me to reorder and was a disappointing experience."
"26","Yup, got to love the made to order, hot subs.  Even their cold cut subs are pretty good.  Their bread is all fresh and large.  So you do need to be careful, because a medium is a large sandwich.  So my approach is to get a medium, then take all of the contents of one of the halfs and put it into the other.  Wastes bread I know, so save it to snack on if you like.The restaurant is old school and and only has booths.  The booths can only hold 4 adults, so not great for larger groups.The sandwiches are made to order, so at lunch you could end up waiting in line.  Worth it if you have the time."
"27","To be honest, I have been really a loyal fan of this sub. Both my husband and I like the grilled sandwiches here very much. But today, I have to submit a complain here. I ordered two grilled sandwiches by phone around noon. (2018-03-7 10:17am) The experience is very very unhappy. The man who answered my phone speak in a very unpolite tone which makes me feel very uncomfortable. At the beginning, I asked to order two medium grilled sandwiches. He asked me which kind. I said I want to build my own. Then he asked me again which kind? I answered I wanted to build my own sub. After that, he start to be rude in his tone and He don't ask me what kind of bread that I want, what choices do I have for the meat, vegetables,...  He just waited there and when I said I want all the vegetables except olives, he said I have to name all the vegetables that I want but do not providing me any choices!!! When I finished my order for the vegetables, he didn't ask me whether I need any source or cheese. Just told me the time that it would be ready and then hang up the phone! You can not imagine how hard his tone is and this experience make me feel do not want to eat sub or anything anymore!!! His tone when he speaked to me makes me feels like I am his enemy!A fan who loves your sub"
"28","I grew up on the Gulf Coast and I miss the crawfish boils and delicious, well-seasoned seafood. After basically giving up on finding good Cajun food in Cleveland, particularly crawfish, I am so happy that this place has opened.Went there on 7/7/17, and they said they've been open for a couple weeks. They're clearly still figuring things out. Our waitress let us know that they're still seeing what's popular before they put together combo meals, and that one of the mixed drinks wasn't being made anymore because it hadn't gotten a good reception. I thought the food was hands-down delicious, and I appreciate them being critical enough of themselves to be in a period of morphing their menu toward what the customer enjoys.Their format now is you choose your seafood by the pound, a sauce, a spiciness level, and any sides. It all gets cooked in a bag to make a big bag of deliciousness. We got shrimp, mussels, crawfish, corn, and potatoes with hot bomb diggity sauce. Definitely a delicious and fun meal. Overall, the experience, service, food, and drinks were all great. Can't wait go to back."
"29","I visited this restaurant on a Friday evening with my boyfriend and we both had a wonderful experience. The staff was very attentive and we were immediately sat. We chose to sit at the bar and our bartender was very personable and made us both the wonderful capri sun style drinks. We ordered calamari, the crab legs, sausage and shrimp. The sausage was AMAZING as were the crab legs. You get a good amount of food relative to price. The place is clean, well lit, and has great decor. I think it is in a great location and a rare restaurant in Cleveland. I would definitely go back! If you had a bad experience, give the place a chance, all new restaurants go through ups and downs but Cleveland deserves a boiling seafood restaurant!"
"30","We got a pound of clams and some sides. The clams were covered in a delicious sauce (the third option, forget what it's called). Unfortunately, many of the shells were empty. Upon complaining we received excellent service- drinks on the house and beautiful conversation with the cook, Team Ny  (his real name -- ask him about it.) Stop in, it's a comfortable place with innovative food. (But maybe avoid the clams, hah)"
