"7","1",NA,"491","I love YT restaurants in general but after the experience I had last night at this branch, I will not go back until the manager that worked last night is fired. I specifically asked about a certain dish based on the photo in the menu. I needed to know because my gut will have major problems if I have gluten. I was assured by the waiter that it was not battered. What came out was was battered chicken fingers and not the chicken wings I ordered. I was then told that they didn't have chicken wings and walked away without asking me if I wanted anything else. We had already waited 20 or so min for the food to be delivered after ordering and the sandwich I ordered (with gluten free bread) to go with the wings was already only luke warm by that point. I ate the sandwich. The waiter returned when I was halfway done with the sandwich and then asked if I wanted anything instead. By that time i wasn't about to wait another 20 min for another entree. The waiter was very nice and simply made a mistake. I was willing to let this all go but then this happened. The waiter came by with this electronic pad for payment. When I went to select my tip, I noticed the tip amounts were dollars more than what the tip percentages should have been. I pointed it out to the waiter and he was surprised and went to get the manager. The manager came over and said ""what's the problem here?""  I thought the waiter would have told him about the tip percentages being wrong. I showed him my bill and told him that a 20% tip based on my bill would be x amount. And then showed him the device and the tip amount it shows for 20%. Much more. He grumbled words I didn't understand and took the device and started punching stuff in it. I asked him if it was basing the tip amounts on the original figure from before they took off the chicken wings. He looked at me and said we don't sell them here. I told him that I had specifically asked about them and was assured that you did and that nothing was battered because of the gluten intolerance. He wouldn't even look at me and he kept doing stuff with the device. Then he put the device in front of me and said type in what you want to give for a tip. I typed in $3. He said to me, ""is that all?"" I said that's more than 20% but he puts my new receipt down with the tip added into the original amount and no pen to sign, turned around and walked away as fast as possible. Next thing I know, I get an alert on my phone as I always do when I'm at a restaurant or store and purchase something. The amount is $4+ more than the total with the tip. Normally it goes through initially for the amount without the tip and the tip shows up during final processing. I couldn't believe his treatment of me to start with but this was too much. I brought my receipts and phone up to him at the register and asked him why he charged me over $4 more than my total with tip. He said he charged me correctly. I said that my bank charge says otherwise and try to show him. He refuses to look at it and said that he put it in correctly and nothing went through yet. I said it obviously did go through because it's already been charged to my account. He said the correct amount will show up at 4:30 am when the bulk processing happens. I asked him how the wrong amount showed up on my account if he put in the correct amount. He just said the correct amount will show up at 4:30 am. At this point, there was no point in discussing the matter with him any further. I told him it had better be correct and that this has been the worst experience. He never looked at me or apologized.  Mind you, this morning the amount on my bank is still incorrect. This manager has committed fraud and is one of the worst restaurant managers ever. I tend to tip 20-30% based on service. Despite the error the waiter made he was still a good waiter in every other way. His tip was more than 25% based on the total. However, charging me an additional $4+ for what, I don't know, was fraud and that I will not tolerate on any level.","3",-2,"0"

"33","3",NA,"75","I've been to Lake Orion, Mi and Rochester, Mi locations once each and had an excellent time at both.  I'd give 5 stars except the following experience. This was the location in Beachwood, Ohio. Food was yummy. Service varied from ignorant to ok. We, a friend, myself and my toddler, entered with a couple in front of us.  We stood there for several minutes. A man who appeared to be the manager returned twice to the hostess, each time having a long conversation about seating. The restaurant was basically empty. The hostess never even looked at us. Finally, during the second conversation I interrupted to say how long we'd waited and could they seat us. The hostess mumbled something about thinking we were with a group. I really hate having to get pushy to get a normal level of service. After that the service from the waitress was acceptable.  She was definitely struggling to serve a pretty slow section. The hostess and carry out staff continued to carry on conversations instead of doing some work.  Management at this location needs to step it up with hiring. The staff was really low quality for this kind of place.","2",1,"0"

There is usually (when we visit) only a few people dining in but the service is still somewhat slow. However, the food is hot and good so I'll take that over slow and cold any day.

My wife orders coffee, ""we are out of creamer, we do have milk"", OK, whatever. Put in a order for wings, pretty simple, it's in their name, it took 1/2 an hour for them to show up.

Cold food (wings covered in cold sauce) (burgers and fries cold) burgers dry thin party terrible! 3. MANAGEMENT AWFUL - the two hours we were stuck at this horrible location we watched management along with several other staff just stand at the entrance area watching varies sports on TV. No help to staff - never checked on any tables. Clearly not managing the food coming out of the kitchen. Just standing there watching TV. This is the second experience at this location and certainly the last. Place is not busy if you feel like sitting alone but that will not speed up service or quality of food. Corporate compare your revenues to that of other locations. I'm sure the numbers match this poor review.","2",-1,"0"
"43","1","32",NA,"Let's start with the housekeeping isn't the greatest.  My waitress then punched in my order wrong.  Finally got that corrected.  They only carry the pink sweetener.  When my new wings come out one is the wrong dry rub.  I've been waiting for about 10 minutes now.  We had to ask three times for napkins. My coworker and I ordered carrots and celery.  Had to ask for those 4 times.  When the manager dropped them off he just put them on the table and walked away.  My waitress just came to my table and asked if I wanted the bill.  No.  I want my freaking wings.  This place is a disaster and should be avoided at all costs.","2",-1,"0"
"44","1","214","29","So I am a regular Bdubs customer. As an NCAA coach, I like my wings and sports. I was recently hired at a nearby NCAA college and on my second day here I decided to go to Bdubs. So a few things to point out....1. The bartender was very friendly. He as a male bartender. I don't remember his name. 2. The baseball wild card game was on. I asked if they can turn down the music and put on the sound of the game. They did it. And then the bartender started talking sports with us. He knew his stuff. That was excellent.3. Food was warm and good. Beer was good. No complaints there!So went to another Bdubs in the area and didn't like that one as much so I will be coming here as my first choice for Bdubs.","2",-1,"0"

You have to pick and choose the time you come here anytime in the evening is a No as the crowd gets rowdy and the servers disappear in the back chit chatting. It's very clear that management has a type of server they like to hire young pretty with attitude and no customer service training. Maybe if they focused more on customer service they would attract a more mature crowd and they could make more of a profit on big sporting events such as boxing and UFC events. This is one of the only BW3 that doesn't order these PPV events because of the crowd it'll attract. Management definitely needs to pull it together.","2",3,"1"

Our less than mediocre wings arrived, delivered by a server we hadn't seen before or would see again. 30 minutes later a server walked by, we caught their attention and asked for the check.I didn't expect much and we didn't get much but they still managed to disappoint us!

"53","1",NA,"5","I've been to Lake Orion, Mi and Rochester, Mi locations once each and had an excellent time at both.  I'd give 5 stars except the following experience. This was the location in Beachwood, Ohio. Food was yummy. Service varied from ignorant to ok. We, a friend, myself and my toddler, entered with a couple in front of us.  We stood there for several minutes. A man who appeared to be the manager returned twice to the hostess, each time having a long conversation about seating. The restaurant was basically empty. The hostess never even looked at us. Finally, during the second conversation I interrupted to say how long we'd waited and could they seat us. The hostess mumbled something about thinking we were with a group. I really hate having to get pushy to get a normal level of service. After that the service from the waitress was acceptable.  She was definitely struggling to serve a pretty slow section. The hostess and carry out staff continued to carry on conversations instead of doing some work.  Management at this location needs to step it up with hiring. The staff was really low quality for this kind of place.","2",-1,"0"

My wife orders coffee, ""we are out of creamer, we do have milk"", OK, whatever. Put in a order for wings, pretty simple, it's in their name, it took 1/2 an hour for them to show up.

No help to staff - never checked on any tables. Clearly not managing the food coming out of the kitchen. Just standing there watching TV. This is the second experience at this location and certainly the last. Place is not busy if you feel like sitting alone but that will not speed up service or quality of food. Corporate compare your revenues to that of other locations. I'm sure the numbers match this poor review.","2",3,"1"

My coworker and I ordered carrots and celery.  Had to ask for those 4 times.  When the manager dropped them off he just put them on the table and walked away.  My waitress just came to my table and asked if I wanted the bill.  No.  I want my freaking wings.  This place is a disaster and should be avoided at all costs.","2",1,"0"
"64","4","214","75","So I am a regular Bdubs customer. As an NCAA coach, I like my wings and sports. I was recently hired at a nearby NCAA college and on my second day here I decided to go to Bdubs. So a few things to point out....1. The bartender was very friendly. He as a male bartender. I don't remember his name. 2. The baseball wild card game was on. I asked if they can turn down the music and put on the sound of the game. They did it. And then the bartender started talking sports with us. He knew his stuff. That was excellent.3. Food was warm and good. Beer was good. No complaints there!So went to another Bdubs in the area and didn't like that one as much so I will be coming here as my first choice for Bdubs.","2",2,"0"

Our server was pleasant but seemed not to be able to answer questions directly, which was moderately annoying.

Went with a group of 5, it must've taken them over half an hour to bring our food out. Either way, we were there for almost two hours and it did not take us long to eat wings. I got the Nacho burger with fries, the fries were classic fries, crispy and right amount of saltiness. Burger was pretty good too, nothing special. I got bone-in dry rub chipotle barbecue wings, the chicken wasn't very tender but the seasoning was great, very flavorful, slightly spicy, just a hint of barbecue. Our waitress came pretty scarcely to our table, we had to flag down a busser to get our water refilled, and that was like an hour into our time there. Mostly rating two stars for minimal service, the time t took for our food to cook and I'd expect better for the price.","2",-1,"0"
"81","4","387","124","It's Bdubs - what more can you expect? This location is fairly large, but despite the obvious availability of tables I'm usually waiting for an employee to amble over and get us seated. Luckily, there's a parking lot out back so you're not worried about your meter running out.The cool thing about this Buffalo though, is that it's home to the Sporcle trivia nights on Wednesday evenings. No charge at all to play, just go to the Game Master (sitting with his mic and laptop next to the bar), pick up the answer forms, pick a team name, and play. The game play is a little different from traditional trivia nights I've been to, but it makes it more interesting wagering points on your answers based on how confident you are. Since you're inevitably going to be waiting, you can ask your waiters for the handheld trivia game device which lets you play against other people nearby. A good way to pass the time and learn random facts. Or train for Trivia Crack I suppose. The other obvious choice is to open your mind to the hyper-stimulation provided by virtually every sports channel you could desire (in the US at least) arranged in collage-like fashion on the walls. Come to think of it, I don't even really know what color their walls are because my eyes never make it past the monitors and I've only gone at night.Tuesday (or Thursday?) nights are $0.50 wing nights, which is a good deal if you're a fan of their wings. Unfortunately, I've always felt like I was taking a gamble whenever I get their wings since some of the flavors that sound appealing are either way too saucy or just plain yucky, and others (that I wouldn't order myself but sample from friends) turn out to be decent. I'm actually more of a fan of their appetizers, which turn out to be surprisingly filling as well. The bathrooms are similarly hit or miss. Sometimes there's only one toilet that has been spared a messy fate and there's no more soap, and other times I emerge feeling refreshed and  clean.","2",2,"0"
"82","1","450","323","Seriously, when I got to Buffalo Wild Wings almost at the end of the first quarter of the season opener, I was on bar number three. The first bar didn't have NFL Sunday Ticket so I could only watch the browns. The second bar was so packed that there wasn't anywhere to go and no servers offered any help or drinks, so we bailed. Finally, Buffalo peeps flailing around in Cleveland, we remembered that there was a new Buffalo Wild Wings where that terrible dance club/bar that was always empty used to be.Wild Wings was expectedly crowded, but there was room to stand in the bar area and we eventually got a table. They have tons of TVs and we were able to easily watch the Browns put up a good fight, the Bills pull out a win, and Miami make Tom Brady cry.This is a pretty standard Wild Wings. The food we ordered was fine and our waitress was great. They were even raffling off a Browns jersey. Our waitress joked that she wasn't sure whether to offer the free tickets to the Pittsburgh table (they were playing the Browns) so I suggested that she tell them that after the Browns beat them, they could use the jersey to wipe away their tears... Too bad Pittsburgh stole the win on a drive in the final seconds of the game.Overall, definitely a good place to watch the games on Sunday. Sad that the places closer to me aren't good choices, but I'll drive up here to watch.","2",-1,"0"
"83","2","162","214","Plus: lot of TVs, show boxing and UFC fights in addition to other sports, multiple ""wings"" optionsMinus: staff, service, quality of foodWe went to BWW to see a UFC fight since this was one of the closest places for us in University Circle. We walked in and were greeted by a semi-polite staff member who told us to sit wherever we wanted and that they would show the UFC fight once it was time! Ok, we pick a seat and within 2 seconds our server comes to the table and asks us what we want...""water for now, give us a minute to decide"" we said since it was literally seconds since we sat down. She follows that up with a rude ""is that all."" Never mind, we wanted to focus on the fight since we are a bunch of enthusiasts so we let it slide.After that poof.... Our server is MIA. After 10 minutes of scanning the room we finally flag her down to give our drink order while simultaneously attempt to order some food lest we lose her again. The ordering portion was extremely unpleasant as she kept interrupting my friend whose English is not perfect. Give him a chance to say what he has to! He was trying to see if he could customize the sampler plate but Our server was in no mood to help him and retorted ""they don't allow us to change anything in the sampler, do you want it or not.""  Finally,We gave up and just ordered what was on the menu.In 5 minutes we get our drinks and in another 15 minutes our food. Since we had requested the mozzarella sticks to be separate from the meat/nachos at the time of our order and since that was not the case when our food arrived,another server offered to get us a new plate of mozzarella sticks. So she goes to do so and on the way mentions it to our server, but she didn't come back to say anything (like it never happened). Ok, it might not have been your fault but at least you can acknowledge the mistake.We ate, drank and our server dropped the check: she never asked us if we were done, and there was still an hour left for the fight. So lady, if I want more drinks should I just get them at the bar? Overall, the nachos and mozzarella sticks were decent, wings felt a little cold. I still appreciate the staff coming us with another plate of mozzarella sticks due to the mistake in the kitchen. However, the remaining service experience was sub-par. Like other yelpers have said, it's kind of a hit and miss so don't expect a lot.You get drinks, ok food and multiple TVs to watch all the sports you wish to watch.","2",0,"0"

When asked about getting the money for the spilled soups refunded, we were instructed to call the Panera directly. Called them and got the run around about getting a refund because they wanted the card number again. It was a company card that our director was in possession of, and he wasn't in the office; so I waited until the following day to call back.When I called the following day I was made to feel like I was being less than reasonable for wanting a refund for the spilled soup. The lady brought up how it spilled in transit. I felt bad for the delivery driver; but that doesn't change the fact that we ended up short on soup for half of our guests. I also advised the lady that we did not receive baguettes for the soup we ordered. She told me they were packed in the bag (which they weren't) and proceeded to try to explain what a baguette was as if I didn't know. At that point, I was over it, and I asked for a refund for the spilled soup as well as the $20 tip charged to the card prior to service. She seemed surprised, possibly even insulted. I'm not saying accidents don't happen, but what ever happened to taking the initiative to make things right when a paying customer doesn't get what they paid for?

There is one unmarked tea/coffee/mystery dispenser.  I opt for a known commodity and soda.  The fountain practically sprays me, but hey, at least there was no actual soda in it.  Just soda water.  I dump the non-soda and sit down to start to write this...It seems that there is disorganized management.  A culture that has accepted mediocre service.  The culture is such that I'd expect a defensive response to this review.  I wouldn't expect them to take responsibility.  If it were a culture of personal responsibility, I wouldn't have needed to write this in the first place.At least the wifi is fast!","2",0,"0"

"152","1","122","64","This particular Panera branch is absolutely horrid. I ordered a simple bagel with cream cheese, sliced and toasted. When I got my bagel, the top portion had been sliced so thin (literally, it was 1-2cm thick) that it burned to the consistency of a potato chip. When I inquired about possibly getting a new bagel, the individual behind the counter said ""no,"" and that it was ""your fault for ordering it toasted."" Wtf? On a separate visit with my family, the soups and mac n cheese we ordered ranged from  lukewarm to bone cold. When we took them back to the counter, we were instructed to use the microwave located near the napkin dispenser. Again, wtf??! AVOID this Panera Bread like the plague. It's most certainly not up to the par of other Panera locations.EDIT: I've called corporate regarding my above experiences, and was informed that I was not the first person to complain about this particular branch. Just an FYI.","2",-1,"0"

"159","1","10","6","Had food catered by this Panera location for a meeting I was hosting at my job. Delivery driver spilled half of the soups that we ordered in the parking lot. When asked about getting the money for the spilled soups refunded, we were instructed to call the Panera directly. Called them and got the run around about getting a refund because they wanted the card number again. It was a company card that our director was in possession of, and he wasn't in the office; so I waited until the following day to call back.When I called the following day I was made to feel like I was being less than reasonable for wanting a refund for the spilled soup. The lady brought up how it spilled in transit. I felt bad for the delivery driver; but that doesn't change the fact that we ended up short on soup for half of our guests. I also advised the lady that we did not receive baguettes for the soup we ordered. She told me they were packed in the bag (which they weren't) and proceeded to try to explain what a baguette was as if I didn't know. At that point, I was over it, and I asked for a refund for the spilled soup as well as the $20 tip charged to the card prior to service. She seemed surprised, possibly even insulted. I'm not saying accidents don't happen, but what ever happened to taking the initiative to make things right when a paying customer doesn't get what they paid for? Definitely will not be ordering from this Panera again under any circumstances.","2",-1,"0"

I'm usually very satisfied with my meal and service, even though I think that the company overprices their items. However, my family and I had a HORRIBLE experience at this location. We went there for lunch, and the restaurant was mostly full with students studying. The only table open was one close to the back near the bathrooms. Typically, this wouldn't be issue, but at this location, it was. My father went into the men's bathroom and commented that it was the grossest bathroom he had ever seen in his life. We told one of the workers about the bathroom, and she proceeded to prop the men's door open to clean it. Given that we were at the table by the bathroom, the smell was horrendous and making all of us gag. My mother then asked the worker to close the door because we were going to be eating, and she rolled her eyes and didn't do it. At this point, we were already having a horrible experience, so we called the manager over. We told her what was happening, and she couldn't care less. She offered no help, and the bathroom door STILL was not closed. After all this, we received our food. I had ordered a full caesar salad and cup of soup. There were about two chopped pieces of romaine lettuce in my salad, and my cup of soup was half full. Once again, we called the manager over to ask about the portions, and she said she was ""just the manager"" and couldn't do anything about it. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!

It felt as if I should have known before I even asked that they ran out and that it was common for them to run out like this. So then we wanted to get a soup and a bagel and she recommends we get the bagel and drink so that we could add the bagel for 99 cents.

Then while they were making them the girl kept getting distracted and stopping to talk to other employees. Meanwhile, they didn't even make the sandwiches at the same time, so once the second one was made, the first one was cold from sitting there and the general manager Heather just stood by and watched. I came again today (Friday 9/1/17) and called 15 min before I arrived to place my order. When I got there, they didn't even start making my sandwiches yet. Once again, I had to wait probably 15 minutes and once the sandwiches were made, they were both completely wrong. I ordered two turkey sausage egg white & spinach sandwiches, one on a plain bagel, one on a cinnamon raisin. When I got my sandwiches, one was on an everything bagel and one was on a sesame. Also, both were regular sausage with tomato and cheese. When I asked for a refund the general manager heather just stood there once again and did nothing. Ironically, a man walked up behind me and asked if his second sandwich was re made yet because they messed his order up and he had been waiting for a while as well.

"194","3","3","3","If you have never been to a CiCis Pizza, it is an all you can eat pizza buffet. I started going to others when I was a little kid, however, more recently their entire business model has changed to ""5 dollars and change"" - the total cost was $5.99. I also purchased a drink, but if you download the app and register, you get a free drink! They have one long buffet with several areas - first the salad bar, which had several different types of veggies and dressings. I did not find any cheese the first time I went, but then I saw that they were in individual containers. There was also a very delicious pasta salad which tasted like Italian dressing. The second ""section"" was the soup and pasta section which included pasta with the choice of either marinara or a white sauce. I had the marinara and it tasted great. The third section had several types of pizza - I had the pepperoni, the New York Style Pepperoni/Sausage, buffalo chicken, and then the deep dish (which I did not like much). I had to say, my favorite was the New York Style, but the others were equally as good. The sauce is a sweeter sauce, which personally I like for my pizza, and I love buffalo chicken pizza, but this one was really dry. One thing that I saw is if you do not like something that is on their bar, you are able to order your own pizza. I personally did not, however, it is an option, and there is a piece of paper for you to go and order from, and then they give you a beeper once it is done. The last section is by far my favorite, and that is their dessert. They are known for their cinnamon rolls which are melt in your mouth delicious.  They also had an apple pie dessert pizza, and from my understanding, it was delicious. Also - the drinks are self serve; it is right by the end of the buffet. There is also an option to purchase chicken wings (they are not included) - but, it's an all you can eat buffet, so unless you NEED chicken wings, it's kind of a waste. If you do not want to eat there, you can always pick up pizza to go, and the prices seemed like what you would pay at a Dominos pizza. Another nice feature of the restaurant is that there is an arcade there with traditional arcade games. Good touch for the kids!Finally - to the reason they got 3 stars, and not 5. The restaurant is gross. The floors were so sticky and the staff does not know how to clean up very well - the entire time I was there, there was a slice of pizza on the floor. Nobody in my party wanted to use the bathroom there because of how gross the place was. The staff was not that attentive either, which you need to be because it is a buffet. Another little thing - there were no plates by the salad, even though the salad was first on the buffet line... The food was great - for $6, it is a great deal, however, the place is very dirty and sticky. I know I will be sending a message to corporate so then they know because that is how bad it was. If you bring your kids, make sure you bring wipes to wipe everything down.","2",1,"0"

"207","1","44","14","Dirtiest place in Brooklyn hands down. Makes a dumpster out back more appealing to eat out of. Tables are never cleaned, plates and silverware usually have leftover food on them. There is always pop spilled everywhere near the machine and the bathroom quite literally smells like your local dump. Staff is friendly, but I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't insects and rodents all throughout the restaurant due to huge lack of cleaning and hygiene.

"209","1",NA,"58","Let me start off by saying that I know buffets all have their downfalls, but this place absolutely takes the cake.   Every table we attempted to sit at was sticky, dirty, or both. The floor near the fountain drink dispenser had ice everywhere & nobody bothered to clean it up as though it wasn't dangerous in any way. There was a worker walking around with a cart & clearing off plates. That cart looked like it was full of diseases & smelled like roadkill left under the hot sun. Also, there is nothing more appetizing than seeing boogers stuck to the window that you're sitting next to.   The food is mediocre at best. The bathroom gave me the need to shower for twice as long as I normally do, & my iron stomach finally found its kryptonite.","2",-1,"0"

"212","1","151","15","Let's just get this out of the way right now. This place isn't Angelo's Pizza or some place that's going to serve up some gourmet pie with unique cheeses and meats. If you're expecting a unprecedented culinary experience, don't go here.However, if you're looking to spend a little and to get a lot to eat in a fun atmosphere, this is the place to go.The manager here is exceptional. He asked us what type of pizzas we wanted him to make multiple times, and he even brought a few pieces out to the table for us. The guy's personality was infectious and jolly and he really made our eating experience a lot of fun.There are some really great pizzas here, in my opinion. The thin crust pizza is good, and so is the BBQ chicken pizza. I always have several helpings of the various types of cheesesticks too. The dessert pizzas are quite good as well. Also, it's good to get a few vegetables in the mix, so be sure to check out their green salad.Sure, there's kids everywhere and the place may not be immaculate, but it's nothing that a personal-sized bottle of hand sanitizer won't fix.I always eat way too much when I come here, so I don't come here very much. When I do, though, I've never left disappointed. Lower your expectations, open your mind, be ready to have some fun, and you won't either!","2",-1,"0"
"213","5","0","157","CiCi's pizza is awesome! It has a buffet of pizzas. Excellent soup and salad.Then it includes a delicious dessert, with brownie cake,  cinnamon buns, and apple pie pizza.Overall, CiCi's pizza should get 100 stars, from its quality of food.","2",3,"1"
"214","2","3","43","If you have never been to a CiCis Pizza, it is an all you can eat pizza buffet. I started going to others when I was a little kid, however, more recently their entire business model has changed to ""5 dollars and change"" - the total cost was $5.99. I also purchased a drink, but if you download the app and register, you get a free drink! They have one long buffet with several areas - first the salad bar, which had several different types of veggies and dressings. I did not find any cheese the first time I went, but then I saw that they were in individual containers. There was also a very delicious pasta salad which tasted like Italian dressing. The second ""section"" was the soup and pasta section which included pasta with the choice of either marinara or a white sauce. I had the marinara and it tasted great. The third section had several types of pizza - I had the pepperoni, the New York Style Pepperoni/Sausage, buffalo chicken, and then the deep dish (which I did not like much). I had to say, my favorite was the New York Style, but the others were equally as good. The sauce is a sweeter sauce, which personally I like for my pizza, and I love buffalo chicken pizza, but this one was really dry. One thing that I saw is if you do not like something that is on their bar, you are able to order your own pizza. I personally did not, however, it is an option, and there is a piece of paper for you to go and order from, and then they give you a beeper once it is done. The last section is by far my favorite, and that is their dessert. They are known for their cinnamon rolls which are melt in your mouth delicious.  They also had an apple pie dessert pizza, and from my understanding, it was delicious. Also - the drinks are self serve; it is right by the end of the buffet. There is also an option to purchase chicken wings (they are not included) - but, it's an all you can eat buffet, so unless you NEED chicken wings, it's kind of a waste. If you do not want to eat there, you can always pick up pizza to go, and the prices seemed like what you would pay at a Dominos pizza. Another nice feature of the restaurant is that there is an arcade there with traditional arcade games. Good touch for the kids!Finally - to the reason they got 3 stars, and not 5. The restaurant is gross. The floors were so sticky and the staff does not know how to clean up very well - the entire time I was there, there was a slice of pizza on the floor. Nobody in my party wanted to use the bathroom there because of how gross the place was. The staff was not that attentive either, which you need to be because it is a buffet. Another little thing - there were no plates by the salad, even though the salad was first on the buffet line... The food was great - for $6, it is a great deal, however, the place is very dirty and sticky. I know I will be sending a message to corporate so then they know because that is how bad it was. If you bring your kids, make sure you bring wipes to wipe everything down.","2",0,"0"

"217","1","98","6","Took the kids to Cici's recently and we enjoyed the $5.00 pizza buffet.  They had some tasty pizzas and some not-so-tasty pizzas.  The stuffed crust pizzas were really good.  My favorite was the stuffed pretzel crust pizza.  It tasted good, was fresh, and had a yummy filling.  You can't beat the price.  Plus, my kids are picky, but Cici's has a pizza for every pallet. Free refills on drinks is always a good thing.We'll probably visit again.","2",-1,"0"

"260","3","98","2","Stopped in for a quick bite after a recent volleyball game. It was 8pm, which is late for us to eat dinner. We didn't want to start cooking at that time, so to Panda Express we went.Upon arrival, there was a short line due to the staff working slowly. There were six employees present, three of them were eating in the dining room, one was handling the drive through, one was cooking, and one was taking dine in orders. Within a few minutes, we were selecting our entrees to go.I ordered Kung Pao chicken over chow mein noodles bowl. My son ordered orange chicken over white rice bowl. My daughter ordered a orange chicken and peanut chicken with fried rice plate. My wife ordered a teriyaki chicken over white rice bowl. We paid $25 and the orders were made and taken to go. This was a very good price to feed four of us, especially when we're used to paying a minimum of $35 for a meal for four.All the way home, the food smelled great in the car! We barely got into the kitchen before we attacked the Chinese goodness. My son took a bite and then ran to the trash to spit it out. He is very sensitive to spicy food. His orange chicken was spicy. I tasted it and it did have a bit of a kick, surprisingly. I then tasted my wife's teriyaki chicken, which had no spice at all. I asked if she could switch with my son, so he could eat something. They switched and he hesitated to eat the teriyaki chicken, but within a few minutes, he made the new dish disappear. My wife said in disappointment, ""...but I wanted teriyaki chicken!""My Kung Pao chicken had a nice kick to it. I didn't like the whole chili peppers in the dish because they're hard to chew. However, they looked nice and I simply tossed them out. The chow mein noodles were also tasty and paired well with the Kung Pao. The bowl was a nice portion. Of course, I could eat more, but I'm trying to reduce my overall mass.I tasted the teriyaki chicken, the orange chicken, and the peanut chicken too. All the food was tasty, if not spicy, save for the teriyaki chicken. The price was right and they have a drive through. We would eat here again. Good stuff.","2.5",0.5,"0"

In fact, i haven't written a Yelp review in a while but I felt the need to say something...First, the food was good. In fact, it was better than I expected it to be. I tried 3 entrees (SweetFire Chicken Breast, Beijing Beef and Black Pepper Chicken) and none was bad. In fact, i would gladly eat these dishes again.The main problem was the management. I walked in and there was a line - not long, but getting there. There were people waiting for food while others were walking past them with their dishes to pay. When I got to give my order I started to let the girl there know what I wanted when the manager (i'm guessing) came and pulled her from the line while I was talking. So, she just walked away. I came to understand that she'd been doing this for a while and this was why others were waiting for their food and while others left without their food - clearly pissed off. In addition to this, they were running out of obvious things like fired rice which they should consider making in bulk to be quickly reheated. So, they're running out of food asking customers to wait and then pulling the employees who were creating those customers' dishes leaving them to be forgotten. It's gonna need to be improved considerably. I'd give the food 4 stars but the service was a 0-1 star experience.","2.5",-0.5,"0"

Nearly 8 dollars for a 2 item combo with barely any food compared to a local run place is totally unacceptable.

Needless to say I wait in the line only to be told that they don't offer small à la carte items and then if I would like a fried rice I have to pay $7.90 for a medium or even more for a large. Can we say bullshit? If you no longer carry a size perhaps you should put something over the menu that says it is not available.

"300","3","2","127","We got a pound of clams and some sides. The clams were covered in a delicious sauce (the third option, forget what it's called). Unfortunately, many of the shells were empty. Upon complaining we received excellent service- drinks on the house and beautiful conversation with the cook, Team Ny  (his real name -- ask him about it.) Stop in, it's a comfortable place with innovative food. (But maybe avoid the clams, hah)","3",0,"0"
"301","5","0","264","I grew up on the Gulf Coast and I miss the crawfish boils and delicious, well-seasoned seafood. After basically giving up on finding good Cajun food in Cleveland, particularly crawfish, I am so happy that this place has opened.Went there on 7/7/17, and they said they've been open for a couple weeks. They're clearly still figuring things out. Our waitress let us know that they're still seeing what's popular before they put together combo meals, and that one of the mixed drinks wasn't being made anymore because it hadn't gotten a good reception. I thought the food was hands-down delicious, and I appreciate them being critical enough of themselves to be in a period of morphing their menu toward what the customer enjoys.Their format now is you choose your seafood by the pound, a sauce, a spiciness level, and any sides. It all gets cooked in a bag to make a big bag of deliciousness. We got shrimp, mussels, crawfish, corn, and potatoes with hot bomb diggity sauce. Definitely a delicious and fun meal. Overall, the experience, service, food, and drinks were all great. Can't wait go to back.","3",2,"0"
"302","5","132","100","I visited this restaurant on a Friday evening with my boyfriend and we both had a wonderful experience. The staff was very attentive and we were immediately sat. We chose to sit at the bar and our bartender was very personable and made us both the wonderful capri sun style drinks. We ordered calamari, the crab legs, sausage and shrimp. The sausage was AMAZING as were the crab legs. You get a good amount of food relative to price. The place is clean, well lit, and has great decor. I think it is in a great location and a rare restaurant in Cleveland. I would definitely go back!
