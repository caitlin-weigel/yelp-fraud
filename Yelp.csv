"2","1.0","3","774","To be honest, I have been really a loyal fan of this sub. Both my husband and I like the grilled sandwiches here very much. But today, I have to submit a complain here. I ordered two grilled sandwiches by phone around noon. (2018-03-7 10:17am) The experience is very very unhappy. The man who answered my phone speak in a very unpolite tone which makes me feel very uncomfortable. At the beginning, I asked to order two medium grilled sandwiches. He asked me which kind. I said I want to build my own. Then he asked me again which kind? I answered I wanted to build my own sub. After that, he start to be rude in his tone and He don't ask me what kind of bread that I want, what choices do I have for the meat, vegetables,...  He just waited there and when I said I want all the vegetables except olives, he said I have to name all the vegetables that I want but do not providing me any choices!!! When I finished my order for the vegetables, he didn't ask me whether I need any source or cheese. Just told me the time that it would be ready and then hang up the phone! You can not imagine how hard his tone is and this experience make me feel do not want to eat sub or anything anymore!!! His tone when he speaked to me makes me feels like I am his enemy!A fan who loves your sub"

Their small is actually twice the size of what I thought it would be. But they are not going to replace other sandwich shops for me. They really go light on the fillings unfortunately. I actually had to take half the bread away because it was just a horrible ratio of tuna to bread."
"4","4.0","38","328","I'm in love with these subs! I get the Veggie with everything except olives. It was like a party in my mouth!The small had to be at least 7"". I almost couldn't finish, but pushed on because it was so delicious.Take a minute and join Club Bread. I received a small sub for free. This would likely become my sub establishment of choice if it were closer to home.Great food and great service."

"8","4.0","42","2","Fabulous bread and decent amount of meat on BIG sub. My medium is basically two lunches. Tasty pasta salad and no problem with big order for entire office."
"9","1.0","0","168","I am disappointed in management not responding to a complaint. I ordered a vegi sub, being vegan, and told the girl I wanted every vegi. When I got gone it I rained every meat they had. I had to pitch it. Tried contacting the location and received no response back. Poor customer service the girl who made sandwich was very nice bit management needs to figure out how to deal with issues"
"10","1.0",NA,"6","The 1 star represents the service not the food.  Came in at 3 pm in the afternoon and nobody was in there.  Two people behind the counter socializing and didn't even acknowledge we were there until 10 minutes of standing there.  By the way we were only a foot away from them and said they would be with us soon while doing nothing.  Took our order by asking ""what do you want"".  Only ordered two subs and my wife's sub she said no olives and don't toast it in which the ignored both requests.  Took there good old time making it.Only writing this because we love the food and hope service gets better so they can last.  We know the chipotle down the street had to fire rehire everyone and start from scratch because of service issues.  Looks to be a trend."
"11","4.0","33","11","I worked up to courage to give Dibella's another try after my previous disaster of a sandwich on a prior visit.  I followed my own advice and kept it simple.Small cold turkey sub on everything bread.  Loved it.The bread is so fresh and chewy.  Veggies are fresh and the turkey was plentiful.  For a sub shop it gets 4 stars, just be careful what you order.  ie Avoid the Dagwood and avoid the hot sandwiches if it involves cold cuts.  It's quick and cheap (especially if you have someone to share a sandwich with).  It's comparable to Jimmy Johns with better bread and bigger sandwiches."
"12","2.0","98","488","Stopped in to DiBella's with wife, mom, and son yesterday for a quick Valentine's Day lunch.  I ordered a medium Philly Cheesesteak, my son got a turkey and cheese, my mom ordered a Godfather, and my wife ordered a Buffalo chicken sandwich.  We paid, grabbed our chips and drinks, and then sat down with our numbers so the waitresses could see them.  They build your sammich and then hunt around the restaurant looking for your number.  When they see your number they give you the sammich and you can begin your indulgence.  DiBella's subs are larger than most sub shops because they give you almost twice the bread as other sub shops.  I'm really not a fan of all the bread, but it is fresh baked and very tasty.  I ordered my cheesesteak on 'everthing' bread, which had a great taste.The quality of the steak used on the sandwich was very good.  I tasted the meat by itself and it had a good texture and a great taste.  The rest of the sandwich was delicious.  I loved it.  It was almost too big to eat at one sitting.  The large sandwiches - don't even go there and less you want to share one amongst two or three people.  I tasted my wife's Buffalo chicken and it was also delicious.  My mom gave me a bite of her Godfather and that was really tasty too.  My son's small turkey sub was too much for him to polish off, but he made every attempt.  Excellent subs!"
"13","4.0","0","723","This place sucks!!! I get there at 8:30 and they are already closed and have cleaned everything up. I come back another night earlier and they are already cleaning up, but they let me order I order a medium turkey, ham, and bacon hot sandwhich with provolone and tomato, lettuce, and mayo. I receive my sub and it is a small sub does not have any bacon, no lettuce and no mayo!"
"14","4.0","17","4","Very good subs, they have great bread and they load the sandwich up with meat.  We order at work all the time for meetings and people absolutely love them.  They are also reasonably priced for what you get.  My favorites are their tuna, the Dagwood, and the Godfather.  Make sure to get their ""everything"" bread, it is just like an ""everything"" bagel.  Delicious."
"15","5.0","0","119","Large sandwiches for the $$. However I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich with everything on it. When it arrived to my table and opened it, only meat. Nothing else. Very blah. They were too busy for me to reorder and was a disappointing experience."
"16","1.0","236","3","I ordered ahead on the way to a concert and the gentleman answering phones told me 10 minutes. I arrived 15 minutes later to my order not ready and ever better, not yet started. There was only one person talking orders / cooking and three others hanging by the register having a conversation. I waited to pay and 5 minutes into me waiting I interrupted to ask someone to ring me out.. Spoke to who seemed to be the manager cooking / taking openers about the wait and all she said was 'oh sorry'. I had to wait an additional 25 minutes for my food to be ready! That's 40 minutes!!  Genuinely disappointed with this location. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!"
"17","4.0","15","9","I just left the restaurant with a sub meal to go. I was greeted promptly and everyone seemed very nice. While waiting for my food, the woman making my sandwich at the grill corrected another employee about the prep, which quickly turned verbally combative in nature. All of this while 3 customers, me included, stood by not knowing what to do during the exchange. If the woman was a manager, she should know to bring up needed information away from customers, not call employees out on the spot, for all to see AND hear. I was so embarrassed by the spectacle, I will NOT be returning. The sandwiches are very good, but not good enough to suffer through the humiliation of fellow workers. Great job on loosing a customer."
"18","1.0","129",NA,"I thought this place was great! I've never eaten here before but I'm a huge fan of their bagel style hoagie rolls! They were so good and make these subs a lot more filling for me. Be careful when ordering sizes and ask their staff because everything is a lot bigger than you would expect. This was very reasonably priced and the staff makes your hoagies pretty quick. I will definitely eat here again!"
"19","1.0","12","47","I love DiBella's.  Absolutely fricken love this place. I wish soooo bad that there was one closer to me so if I had a complaint that would be it. The subs here are unlike any other place you will get them. Blows subway, penn station...you know what. You can't even say those names in the same breath bc DiBella's is that much better. I have got the got the Dagwood and the godfather before and they are both just ridiculously good. I have heard good things about their cheesesteak as well and I imagine that will be my next one I try. Just move close to Cuyahoga Falls please!"
