"April F.",1,"This was the worse place. <U+00A0>They claim their policy is for patrons to pay $100 deposit if party over 10. Well we weren't told that and when asked for manager he stated they trained everyone to say that. Finally he let us be seated. <U+00A0>After sitting for 45 mins and no one asked if we wanted to place our order, wanted water or anything, <U+00A0>we decided to leave. They lost over $500 just because didn't wanna serve us.","30","1"
"Loreal R.",1,"So the very first time I came to this restaurant I had a really great server however myself and my best friend ended up getting a show and dinner. It was a hot mess the owner got into an altercation with an ex employee and the whole restaurant was now watching them argue. Luckily the chef made up some crazy dessert to make it up for free. That was cute, but the second time our server sucked. She didn't ask if we were coming in for anything special no dialogue whatsoever. (I take it personal because I was a server/waitress and it's just how you make your money) Anywho she sucked pretty much definitely wasn't the same experience like the first. Lastly, my last and final time coming to this place I just wanted some take out. First of all you have to come in and order it like what the hell is the point of take out lol? But anywho it took me 10 mins to order and then 10 extra mins to pay. Honestly, the whole restaurant needs to go back to restaurant training for everyone's position. No one knows what they're doing, they have no personality to make you feel welcomed. The only reason I feel this place is still standing is because the food is actually decent. Not as great as Hot N Juicy in DC but it's up there. I just hope someone from the restaurant actually changes this dynamic. They can totally be the hottest spot out if they get their shhhh together.","87","1"
"Erin R.",1,"PUBLIC HEALTH WARNING: WE WERE SERVED ROTTING FISH. Imagine cutting into a fillet of catfish, bringing the fork close to your face and then gagging on the smell of the worst dirty diaper you can imagine. I was concerned when I stopped in the rest room to wash my hands and found my shoes sticking to the floor as I approached the door. Inside there was a giant hole in the wall down to the metal drywall frame, the sink was DISGUSTING and there was a Mother actually wash the toilet seat with soap and tissue before covering it so her little girl could safely use the facilities. The walls are visibly filthy and my husband found the men's room to be equally neglected. I would have walked out then if we had come alone. But our friend had ordered and was also waiting for her meal. When I called the waitress over to smell the food we had been served. She was visibly shocked and and took the plate straight to the ""manager"" without saying a word. <U+00A0>When she returned she apologized profusely and agreed that the fish smelled like ""butt"". Apparently the manager had initially disagreed with her and suggested that it was a fishy smell!! She had to insist that he put his face in the napkin and be honest about whether he would eat it. Ridiculous. If they have gone nose blind to the smell ROTTING (not spoiled, not slightly old, not low quality. ROTTING) food in the kitchen I wonder how much of it is in there?! We've all left something in the fridge too long. But most people deposit those findings in the trash rather than battering and frying them up for guests. The manager. Lord have mercy, the ""manager"". When he came out, he apologized and then tried to tell me the food wasn't rotting and because they prep their food daily. I asked for his explanation on how else one might achieve a smell like that in food to which he back-peddled and replied ""well, some things might have gotten mixed up in there"". My Translation: ""we are running such a s*#! show in the kitchen that we have no idea what we are serving, how old it is, how to address the basic cleaning and sanitation requirements of running a restaurant or how to protect the public from the dangers of mishandling food. If you die after eating here, we're really sorry about that. ""He further admitted to not having even stepped foot in the bathrooms to check on them and said he had been away. I asked if it was a year-long vacation. It was 2 days. Must have been a very rough 2 days. Then he offered us dessert...as if I would feed a dog anything off the table in there, forget the floor scraps. To clarify, I am no lover of dogs yet as God's creatures, they too deserve better.","0","2"
"Halana H.",1,"Went here 3-17-18 9pm with my kids and their friends, we were told our wait would be 30min. After waiting an hour and then taking two parties of 4 that came in after us,I spoke to someone who said they were waiting on a server that can take our large party. We finally get to our table and sit there for about 5min when our server comes over so we can finally order drinks. Drinks did not come for 10minutes after our order at this point it's 10:30pm <U+00A0>and my daughter is falling asleep at the table. After expressing my disappointment with the server he gets an attitude. Once the food was ordered and came out the attention of our server was minimal. The shrimp was over cooked and soggy. Refills were needed. My kids wanted dessert when asked he looked at his watch and said he does not think it can be done because it was now 11pm (closing time) this is the first I have ever heard of that. The server came back and said that he can place an order for two desserts mind you we had a party of 8! To top this horrible experience off the bill was $306 dollars for over cooked shrimp and bad service. We arrived at this place at 9pm and did not get home until 12! Do not eat here unless you plan on staying here all day and like overcooked seafood!","0","1"
"Jae R.",1,"I visited this location due to a birthday dinner. I went to to the bar to wait for the rest of my party and received the worst attitude from the bartender. After waiting for a 10 minutes to be helped. I placed my drink and appetizer order. After another 10 minutes I decided to change my drink order. I asked had my drink been started and the bartender responded with no. I then asked if could change the drink. The bartender immediately got upset and stated hurry up cause I already rang in your order and was nasty from there. I then declined and told him to cancel the drinks altogether due to his behavior. A few minutes later he came back to apologize.Now on to the dinner service... this had to be the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. We were given two servers.. great. We were immediately told that the checks could not be split and had to pay together. I then asked why was this not conveyed when the reservation was made as I had to pay $200 for a deposit. The server then agreed to split the checks 4 ways. The food took forever to come out and those who ordered crab legs were not given a cracker. We were told people steal them and we ran out. After the dinner service was over we had wait about 30 minutes to get the cash deposit back. I will NERVER return here at all. The catfish nuggets were awesome but overall flavor of the broil was just okay. Mix that with bad service I'll NEVER GO AGAIN!","0","2"
"Dora A.",1,"My husband and I were excited to eat here, we came very hungry. Server was nice got us our drinks and took our orders. It wasn't very busy. 25 minutes passes and I realize people who came in after us are getting their food. Our waitress comes back and tells us a couple more minutes. 20 more minutes pass still no food. She comes back and tells us the kitchen just got our ticket... my husband was way to hungry to wait any longer so we ended up leaving. The place looks very cool and everyone was really nice, can't say anything about the food because we didn't try it.","0","1"
"Bob S.",1,"Horrible experience. <U+00A0> The staff was uninterested in providing service, from the bartender, wait staff and management. <U+00A0>Took us 5 minutes to get a draft AT THE BAR. <U+00A0>When we sat down, we got plastic forks because they had two large group of 20 and 30 so I guess they only have 50 sets of silverware ( weird) The menu is either boiled or fried, and expensive. <U+00A0>I had the Cajun chicken salad which was a salad with 6 uneatable Shimp's rolled in Cajun pepper. <U+00A0>I love spicy food as do the folks I was with, and none of us could eat one. <U+00A0>When we told the waitress how bad it was she just said ""that's the way Cajun food is"" and walked away. <U+00A0>When the manager came by and asked how thing were we told them the food was horrible he just shrugged his shoulders and walked away. <U+00A0> <U+00A0>With all the other options in the area, pick another place.","0","6"
"Hanh P.",1,"I visited this past Thursday night and it wasn't my first visit but this one was the worst time I've had here. The place wasn't packed, minus a really large birthday party. I was greeted promptly and asked if I wanted anything to drink, and I asked for a water. It took forever to get my server back to take my order, maybe 20 minutes until he came back around. He apologized for the wait and then asked again what I'd like to drink. This pattern of forgetfulness continued throughout the night. The food took forever to come out, and the waiter explained they were short-staffed tonight which is understandable. I waited roughly another 30-40 minutes for the food and the waiter mentioned that he would bring back a scrap bucket. I waited patiently for the scrap bucket before digging in, but after 5 minutes I assumed he forgot. I then saw him walking around to other tables, mingling with customers he knew. 20 minutes passed and he checked in and asked how things were and I asked again for a scrap bucket. The food is normally very good, but this visit, my crab legs were not up to quality. You can always tell when seafood isn't good quality and I could tell from the way they were cracking and just looked that they were not the freshest in the bunch. They were edible but not great quality. I chose to continue eating because I was starving at that point in the night. Overall, the customer service was terrible and the food quality for the night left a lot to be desired.","159","15"
"Norlynn S.",1,"Totally disappointed! I attended a birthday dinner for a friend. Because we were a large party I expected some hiccups, this was a total disaster. One half of the party was served entrees 40-45 minutes before the other half. We received salads and appetizers 10-20 minutes after entrees. Salads were brought to the table with no salad dressing. Once the salad was delivered to the table we were told they were actually out of the salad dressing. <U+00A0>When we asked the server for a manager he said ""I'm looking for him he disappeared."" When the manager was located 15 minutes later, he was not helpful or apologetic. Moral of the story?DO NOT HAVE A DINNER PARTY HERE!","0","6"
"Nora R.",1,"Can't quite say how the food is.. we sat at the bar for about 20 minutes without anyone even offering us water. We saw how horrifically dirty the bar was kept, and we decided to leave before paying $35+ apiece for what would undoubtedly give us food poisoning. This place has such potential, it's a shame that none of the employees have any idea what they're doing.","0","20"
"Stephanie H.",1,"I attended a birthday dinner for my sister there were 27 of us in total. We had made the reservation 3 weeks ago. Had to pay a $100 deposit no biggie. I get there a half hour early to decorate and they have a table setup for 12 people in the area we specifically requested not to be seated. Rhey had to scramble to setup the additional seating we needed. This should have been a sign the night was going to suck. We let that go everyone arrives they give us one waitor for 27 people. The service sucked it took over 40-50 minutes to get our food. And we all got our entrees and pieces of our orders at different times. When we finally got our good it was great. However, I will never patronize this place again the service was horrible.","78","1"
"Adria H.",1,"Horrible experience! <U+00A0>Had reservations for 8pm. It was busy. Was seated promptly & that was the only good thing that happened. We ordered some drinks and apps right away. The drinks arrived about 20 minutes later. We ordered our meals. Another 1/2 hour passed and we finally received our apps. The only item not covered in grease was the catfish nuggets. About 45 minutes AFTER that we still had no dinner!! <U+00A0>I spoke to a bartender, who said he was the manager. All he did was say, I'll see what's going on. A different server than our original popped over to our table and apologized saying it was just busy. I pointed out that we watched the surrounding table arrive after us, receive their meals, EAT their meals, and were now leaving. He really had no response to that. They did not offer to buy us a drink or make any other attempt to please us. <U+00A0>I am not one to walk out on a check, but I was pretty angry, not to mention hangry. <U+00A0>So we stood up and left. <U+00A0>Probably will not return EVER!!!","0","9"
"Robin C.",1,"The only good thing about our visit was Joe. <U+00A0>He was awesome! <U+00A0>My daughter had heard about Boiler 65 and was excited to go her <U+00A0>commencement. <U+00A0>I was upset that her special day was ruined. <U+00A0>The service was extremely slow. <U+00A0>We had a party of 12. <U+00A0>My niece went in and sat at the bar while awaiting the arrival of the remaining guest. She ordered drinks at the bar and placed an order of country wings. <U+00A0>By the time we were seated 20 minutes later, she still had not received her wings. <U+00A0>Joe seated us and took our orders both beverages and food. <U+00A0>Joe stated that he was not a server but was trying to help out by taking our order. <U+00A0>Joe said he was going to put our order in and go get our beverage order. <U+00A0>By the time Joe delivered our beverage order a different person who said he was the bar manager can to our table to take our order.

If you want good cajun seafood and good service, go to Boiling Seafood Crawfish on Lee Rd.Spoke to the ""real"" <U+00A0>and my niece asked to at least lower gratuity from 18% to 15%. <U+00A0>He only offer was manager to give a few desserts. <U+00A0> I will not be back.

"Christian B.",1,"This place is terrible. If you find yourself entering this place, turn around and leave. We were sat and no one greeted us for more than 15 mins. Terrible service. I'll never be back and I will tell everyone to do the same!","3","5"
"Lucyy D.",1,"If I could take away stars I would. We had reservations at 8pm for a large group. By 11pm we we were still waiting on our food. This place is very unorganized and the Owner needs to go back to Business School or invest his money somewhere else. We had to argue and act like a bunch of foods in order NOT to pay for the dinners that they were trying to make us pay for? They kept sending watered down drinks to the table; which we weren't interested in and at one point was offered $100 off a potential 2K bill. NO THANKS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AT THIS PLACE! It was sad because we were celebrating a Birthday and The Boiler 65 ruined her surprise and dinner. TERRIBLE... TERRIBLE....TERRIBLE","0","1"
"Kayla G.",1,"Was very excited for a local eatery with a fun take on a meal, but was left wanting more.First, the waitress dragged our tablecloth (piece of brown paper) across the ground. Which wouldn't have been an issue had we have been given plates, but the paper was supposed to be the plates.We ordered 3 different meats and veggies. The corn was described as 3 half ears but they were lacking, barely even two bites long. The potatoes were all mashed within the meat and different shells had gotten mixed within them. This made them even harder to eat. Even the drinks were lack luster, the idea of an adult Capri sun is exciting! But when they appear to half full and lacking any flavor, $13 is quite steep. Beyond that, we sat outside and there was some poor planning on the restaurant's side. The picnic tables were wood and were all awkwardly stained with grease giving the appearance of dirty tables. I would have recommended plastic or metal options to ensure the grease stain didn't happen.I truly wanted to enjoy the food but was just so underwhelmed.","36","41"
"Tiffany J.",1,"Upon entering The Boiler 65 the decor was beautiful and the atmosphere awesome. My party of 2 was seated outside. As soon as we were seated the issues began. We didnt get a tablecloth, utensils or napkins until maybe an hr after being seated. My seafood boil had a long black hair in it and my partners food took about an hr to come out. They showed no concern or even tried to accomdate us for the bad service. It was not until my partner became highly upset, a manager trainee named Josh did his best to make up for the horrible service. Needless to say, Boiler 65 has a long way to go.","52","1"
"Augustine H.",1,"Service is terrible. Has so much promise with location and style of food but can't get over the terrible service. Whether it is waiting a long time or not getting orders right there is no reason for being this bad. Almost as if they are trying to be bad. Called for a pick up order for 20 minutes. Because I had been here before and knew the service was bad asked specifically if they were sure that this was going to be ok. Went to the restaurant 20 minutes after ordering and was asked who took my order and then waited an additional 35 minutes. If you want a crab boil go to the east side. You don't want these crabs.","150","3"
"Courtney H.",1,"The service is terrible on a Friday night with not a lot of people at the location it still took over 15 min for <U+00A0>the server to bring a drink. So i went to the bar to get my second drink and yet again it took 15 min. The food was OK the service def needs some major improvement and the waitress threw my food out when I specifically told her I wanted a to go bag","5","3"
"Kendra D.",1,"If I could rate it a zero I would. Just had one of the worse restaurant experiences in my life. First of all, I was a fan of this restaurant far before it opened. Patiently awaiting the establishment to commence business. My husband and I made our way to the restaurant Saturday 7/29. Approached the hostesss desk and were told it'd be a 30-minute wait. 30 minutes pass so we go and follow up - now being told it was an additional 20 minute wait. During this second round of waiting, I witnessed two parties on the <U+00A0>list after us get seated. Oh, and I should mention there were at least 4 empty tables. Including a two that we were told were on hold for a reservation. (In 20 minutes, that reservation never showed up). At this point we ask for a manager and he doesn't apologize. Just pours on excuses, such as someone quit today. And then sits us at one of the empty tables. As we are browsing the menu, said manager comes back and says ""it'll be a while before a waiter gets to you."" I ask how long and he says I don't know, but it will be a while."" I'm over my limit of patience, so we leave. There are two other restaurants with this style of serving, so there's no reason for me to ever patron Boiler 65 again. And you shouldn't either.","0","3"
"Sara K.",1,"I'm so sad. I wanted this to go well. It did not. We came in there were maybe 20 people in the restaurant. Our first hint things weren't going well, the hostess was out of menus. The restaurant was maybe at 20% occupancy. She said we can sit at the bar. So we go to the bar and there is a whole stack of menus. The menu was a surprise because potatoes or corn was ""extra"" and not part of the boil. We continue to try and ordered the adult Capri sun style drinks. They are 13 bucks... and mine was decent, the lemonade the other was pretty bad. The server offered to fix it and asked what else we would like to put in it. Opted for some ginger ale and it improved. While we were waiting to put in an order we started to see the disarray. Tables were coming to the bar to get drinks while all the servers were hanging out in the back fixing their own drinks. One table was completely ignored for at least 20 minutes till an off duty employee intervened. We put in an appetizer order, still trying. Out came calamari. Extremely over done. No sauce. We were asked if we wanted hot sauce or tartar sauce. Tartar sauce and seasoning was solid. We realized things weren't getting better and tried to cash out. 2 drinks and an app 40 bucks. It took 20 more minutes just to leave. We were told the printer was out of paper. If they got some staff training and front of the house management I feel like they could make progress. People seemed to enjoy the food once they got it. Maybe we will try again.","56","36"
"Wanda L.",1,"Service was VERY slow. I waited 15 standing by the bar before someone bothered to tell me that takeout order would take 35 minutes and when I came back after 50 minutes I waited for another 15 minutes. When I finally got home I realized they were missing the potatoes in my order. And no napkins utensils or anything. Terrible experience. Will not come back.","125","5"
"Ohio City G.",1,"Full candor, I didn't even eat here. <U+00A0>We tried to though, but no one would seat us despite the place being empty (sans two children's birthday parties). <U+00A0>Pros and cons from not eating:Pros: <U+00A0>Inside buildout is solid, if not a little empty feeling.Cons: <U+00A0>Outside was forgotten. <U+00A0>They've got a great patio space which they just gave up on. <U+00A0>Plant some flowers, put up some cafe lights, stop being lazy. <U+00A0>This whole place seems lazy.Put a f*^cking host at the front. <U+00A0>We just stood at the front of the restaurant for 15-20 minutes with no attention. <U+00A0>Turn on some tunes. <U+00A0>STOP serving your food in plastic beer tubs (it's not charming, it's janky). <U+00A0>If you're going to charge those prices, increase your quality, your portion size, and your presentation (e.g. your laminated menus are straight out of a public school cafeteria). <U+00A0>I'm glad they built this place out for the next tenants, because without a re-brand, this Dave & Busters version of a seafood restaurant has a 6 month half-life.","2","17"

"Lucas L.",2,"As soon as my girlfriend I arrived, six workers were chasing a family out of the restaurant....ya, you can already tell how this experience went. Apparently they got up and just left because they waited over thirty minutes for their dinner. I guess the food was done right after they had gotten up, hence the workers chasing them down to pay the bill, but they didnt..understandably. On to my side of the night. We walk in and the hostess barely cracked a smile. There was literally one girl seemingly doing everything while others just stood around. We had got the food to go fyi. The wait was longer than expected, close to thirty minutes give or take, and the place wasnt busy. As for the meal, we were so disappointed. We got two seafood boils. The sauce was basically mild wing sauce mixed with a pound of lemon juice. More sour than anything. Not a trace of garlic to be found. Imo, that ingredient is crucial. All in all, <U+00A0>they need to hire a new hostess that is pleasant and welcoming, less lemon, and faster service. We will not be going back any time soon.","0","1"
"Mazen A.",2,"I came here after work with a coworker. As we walked in, there was approximately 10-15 people waiting for tables, however there was no one in the restaurant and there were several tables available. As I stood there waiting, the hostess saw me as I walked in and she continued her conversation with her other co workers. She then took my name down and informed there was a 20 minute wait, however I was still in awe because the restaurant was empty. As we were waiting, another couple came in and they were seated prior to us. I believe the hostess name was Nauca (unknown on correct spelling), however she was rude and unprofessional. Even upon sitting us, she did not say a word, threw the menus on the table and walked off. Thankfully our server, Emily, was amazing. She was kind, prompt, and respectful. Her knowledge of the menu was excellent and she did not disappoint. We ordered the broil for two, and was not disappointed. The food was tasty. A lot of effort for little meat, however I enjoyed the experience and the flavors. The location is ideal and opened windows allow you to get a nice breeze. The ambience was good and appreciated the open layout. As mentioned earlier, I was just upset with our hostess and her attitude. I am not sure if I will come again just based on that.","125","20"
"Chris D.",2,"So I really wanted to give this place more stars. But nope can't do it off the services and the environment alone. I'll start off like this.... have u ever been at a table and u just got ur food and some one ask hey are u gonna use the salt and pepper (because they want to use it at another table that's not even there yet). This whole situation just got dumber all the way till we were about to leave. But I will say this. The food was amazing. The boiling bags were expensive but worth it based on ALLLLLL THE FOOD in it. Also we their wings and cat fish were season well and delicious. This place would be perfect for the to go menu. So DoorDash or Uber eats or even grub hub this whole experience. But don't sit down. Now back to the dumb ish. So if it's ur first time there u would think someone would give u a run down on the menu and the specials cause this place is a bit unique cause they sell bags of seafood that you pick what all goes into. ANYtime the menu has steps 1 through whatever on it, the server should give you a rundown. But no this didn't happen until. I said ""yo so we have never been here. You should give us and explication on how things work."" <U+00A0>I'm assuming kid was new cause he was confused the whole time. <U+00A0>Next we order shots of absolute, I don't believe this is the servers fault but still I must mention it. Dude comes back and says we don't have absolute. We go ok well let get Tito's. He then comes back with 4 absolute shot glasses with I'm guessing Tito's in it. I was to dumb founded to even think about anything but I need this drink now. Then he comes out with the food, which includes the appetizer we wanted first. Yep instantly pissed about that. So does it get better u ask. Nope, the. He never brings the bibs which everyone else has, napkins, crackers for the crab legs and for gets we ordered more drinks. Also I didn't want coleslaw I wanted to substitute it for more fries which he suggested and came out with coleslaw. On a positive they added crab legs to my girls boil bag which we didn't order so that was a win. So this whole experience, other than the food which was good, was a joke. Even the hostess looked like she was posing for Vogue. <U+00A0>Like i just wanted a smile and how u doing not a straight face like ur ready for the picture that's not being taken. Like I said the food was great but I refuse to go back. Shit cost too much for all that extra lack of customer service. If it wasn't for them hush puppies I prolly hated the whole experience. But like I said. The food was amazing","99","37"
"Tasita G.",2,"The food was alright for a seafood place in Cleveland.The service was okay, my server, James was nice and helpful during my dining experience. However, when I noticed the next day that i was charged TWICE for my bill, that's when the unprofessionalism, rudeness and harshness came out when I called the next day. I called Sunday, May 6th at 12:06PM and I woke with a gentleman who said he was a supervisor. When explaining my situation he immediately sound annoyed and I could hear him sighing with impatience. When he took my information he put me on hold, I could hear how him, my server and a couple other employees there speaking to each other and it was disturbing... I could hear the manager yelling at my server the night before and my server responding back in a negative way. I could hear him yelling ""I only charged her once, look. look!!"" And he yelled back ""you're the only white guy who fits her description!!"" When they found my signed copy. After they found my ticket from the night before, the one I signed, they told me unless I had my customer copy they weren't going to do anything about the issue. Trying to have better understanding of the situation, I asked ""even though you have my signed copy and I have my bank statement saying there are 2 separate transactions for $87.48 you can't do anything without my copy?""The manager told me no and hung up on me when I asked for his name so I could speak to him in the future if I found it. The situation honestly made me feel horrible and uncomfortable, especially knowing I'm out almost $100 for nothing and they don't even care. This was my first time dining in at Boiler 65, and I thought I had found an amazing new seafood restaurant I can go to, but unfortunately I will not be returning.","0","3"

"John B.",2,"What sucks is that the food is good and the venue is cool, but it is literally the worst customer service i have ever experienced. It's like they hired servers that had no intentions on ever being servers. Waited at our table for fifteen minutes without being seen. Finally tracked down a hostess who had to run around the place to find someone that was willing to serve us. I am saying willing because i saw her ask one server who obviously didn't think it was his job to see our table. Been here two occasions and have had the same results. What a shame","6","1"
"Hayley R.",2,"BAD service. Came with a party of 9 for a birthday. Made a reservations a week in advance, and they did not have a reservation for us when we arrived. All our meals were brought out at different times and one meal came 25 minutes after all the others. I had to go to the bar to get ketchup, since the waiter kept forgetting to bring it over. We brought a cake, they kept it in the back and they said it would be brought over right away when asked, and I am still waiting for the cake now while I am writing this review. Won't be recommending to others. Has high hopes, food was good but highly disappointed in the service.","3","6"
"Aisha M.",2,"Food tastes good but they used way to much seasoning on certain foods it's like when you double season your food and it's salty, just high blood pressure waiting to happen.Customer service was HORRIBLE ... we at down at 7:30 and ordered but didn't eat until 8:45 almost 9:00 not mentioning out food came out in portions (not all together) so it you order multiple things don't expect for it to all come out at the same time. Our waitress was what made the visit worse, we tried to be understanding that she was new but she messed up our bill at the time of check out and it took over hour to fix our bill because the manager wouldn't help her (because she needed to learn the new system) and after the FOURTH time she gave it to us wrong he stepped in and told her to just erase the bill and retype it in but at this point we had been waiting for over a hour to receive our bill they eventually fixed it and took something off but I won't ever go back and recommend this place which is kinda disappointing.","0","1"
"Vern D.",2,"I""m not sure about this concept . Or the layout <U+00A0>with the big open doors in the front and nothing inside the door. I'm not with it. <U+00A0>I ate here twice, because the wife loves seafood. I'm from the neighborhood. <U+00A0>The food was excellent <U+00A0>and expensive. Service hit or miss. My opinion. They got operational issues. Maybe they ran out of money or something like that, or got sold before it opened. Its not inviting to come in and eat. <U+00A0> the patio is laid out wrong, The exhaust fans belong on the roof, But the big issue with me , and I cant see how they can fix it. Is <U+00A0>the garbage stinks to high heaven in summer of rotten seafood. Its the city lot layout. They cant hide the garbage dumpster in the summer, and its ruined the patio, and it stinks far away. and I'm not going back to smell stinking garbage. <U+00A0>This is more about pitfalls of doing business in a city on small lots. Selling seafood. My opinion is it wasn't thought out correctly. I generally drive to the Kumo seafood buffet on snow road if I want seafood. I was hoping for a close to my house location but this aint it.","0","15"

"Ryan L.",2,"Went to this restaurant on 6/22/2017. The service was pretty poor. It took about 10-12 minutes for a waiter to bring us water when we arrived, and the place didn't even seem busy at that time.The food is on par at best. Their crawfish are laughably small and it is unsatisfying to eat them. I would not go to this restaurant if you plan on satisfying your hunger, as the amount you get is small for the price. Because this just opened, I will visit this restaurant again in a few months to see if they made any improvements. But as it is right now, I would not recommend it to any of my friends.","68","3"
"Nikki H.",3,"I was really excited about trying this place. It was just ok! I must say someone said it's like an expensive Joe's crab shack, and I must agree. The place is huge and the service was ok. The food came out hot. The crab boil isn't what I expected though. You have to order everything separately. <U+00A0>Potatoes, corn, and sausage is normally in these types of bags, so to have to order them separate with an additional cost is crazy. The corn on the cob were tiny. It looks as if they cut a whole ear of corn to be able to give these tiny pieces. I was disappointed with that. I probably would not visit again, just was not impressed...","17","14"
"Ryan W.",3,"We ate here and split an order of fries along with one of the steamers of mussels and shrimp. Overall the food was pretty good and the service was good also. They serve up steamed pots of seafood with veggies and offer several degrees of spiciness & seasonings. It was tasty, but also very messy. They provide bibs & plastic gloves which helps, but this this definitely wouldn't be a ""first date"" kind of place! A good place to try, but I'm not sure it's something I'd try again.","1","21"
"Annette S.",3,"2nd visit and still sub-standard service from bar and ordering. Food was delicious and served promptly after ordering.

Paid $$$$ but poor customer service overshadowed the goodness of the whole dining experience","0","8"
"Pluto O.",3,"I've eaten here three times. The food is fantastic. Way better than I honestly expected for a seafood joint in Cleveland. I day dream about going back for the food quite often. However, all three times I've eaten at The Boiler I've had absolutely terrible service. I've had a different server every time and all three of them have taken (no hyperbole) 20+ minutes to bring me a soda or a beer. That's INSANE. They always forget something and they completely disappear from my area for extended periods of time.Shoutout to whatever FOH manager is reading this, I completely blame you and not your staff. The fish stinks from the head. Handle your business, set some standards and train your staff.This place has so much potential.I will gladly rewrite this review if during my next visit I see improvement.","0","4"
"Alison H.",3,"The one thing I will say is this.. the food is delicious.. but the WAIT?!? Super long.. we came in with a big birthday party.. they provided us two servers to assist.. half of our table got food waaaay before the other half.. like I understand we have two servers but why are we still waiting and the other side of the party is already done eating. Ridiculous!! Great food but this insane.. also 3 Long islands.. $50!! Insane.. I may or may not be back..","135","31"
"Siroda D.",3,"Went here with two girlfriends. Having been to another local place with a similar concept, I knew what to expect. <U+00A0>The restaurant itself is nice enough. Very spacious and open. <U+00A0>I arrived after my friends and they let me know that once they were seated, no one came to the table for at least 20 minutes. We all placed drink orders and were happy with what we got from the menu. We had their adult Capri Suns and I can definitely recommend those. We ordered <U+00A0>Chicken and Waffles to share and found that one of the pieces of chicken <U+00A0>was not cooked all the way through. It was still bloody by the bone. They did take it away and make a fresh batch . I also wish that they had more than one combo meal for the seafood. But it was more than enough for the three of us. We got their Bomb Diggity sauce and it was pretty good. They allow you to customize how spicy the dish is. <U+00A0>The server also suggested that we could add spice after the fact. We decided to do that and found it it was still lackluster. They provided plenty of napkins, wet naps, crackers, gloves, and bibs. Service was adequate after that slow start. They checked on us pretty frequently, which we appreciated. All in all, I won't be rushing back. But if you're into this Seafood in a bag setup, it may be worth checking out.","123","27"
"John B.",3,"If you're looking for a different type of restaurant experience -- this place is it.I realized that as I stuck my hand (plastic gloves and bib provided) deep into the bag of tasty butter sauce to first pluck off a snow crab leg and then a boiled potato. I crackeded open the leg -- half-closing my eyes to avoid flying shell fragments -- and pulled out the yummy meat that had soake dup the butter it was cooked in. After doing that couple of more times I tossed the mangled leg into a basket and then took a bite out of the potato, sans knife and fork.The meal was messy and primal but it was also perfectly cooked, errr, boiled, and lightly seasoned with Cayenne. I had ordered the 1 lb. of snow crab legs ($22) and a side of potatoes ($3) and they came out about 10-15 muinutes later in a steaming plastic bag that sat in a small bucket. But you can also order everything from shrimp to lobster tails and other sides like corn and sausage and they would all come the same way.There are also other menu items for those not looking to get messy.Now, Jeannene didn't enjoy it as much since (1) she thinks plain white toast is too spicey and at this restaurant everything seems to have at least a pinch of cayenne; and (2) she doesn't like to get messy eating her food and the messiness factor here is much higher than eating wings or ribs, even with plastic gloves and bib!She had gone with the crab roll sandwich and Bombdiggity fries ($15), merely shaking her head at the mess I was making. And even the cayenne sprinkled on the sandwich and fries was too much for her (Thus learning why they are called Bombdiggity fries).We just went with soft drinks but their drink menu looks like as much fun as the food and I will be back to try one of their mixed drinks in a ""Booze Bag.""The ambiance here is very casual with large-screen TVs showing the Cavs game and the ceilings are high, the floor is cement and the music is loud so it's kind of hard to hear. But despite that, there were a lot of large groups here on a early Sunday evening enjoying a family meal.","12","56"
"Jake D.",3,"I was excited to get boiling seafood on the west side. This place is okay. Flavor is okay might be a bit too oily compared to sauce. Shrimp was small and crawfish wasn't fresh.","220","3"
"Jeannine M.",3,"Service was awesome food was awesome but music was terrible I don't want to listen to Soulja while eating with my family... Seems more like a club then a restaurant. Food was amazing and so was our server definitely won't go back with our kids though.... Hope they get a new front of the house standing outside in the front doorway will not bring you in a good crowd... But it was great just won't be able to take my kids next time. Take extra money n be prepared especially if you are a good tipper it's pricey but your at a broiler","66","5"
"Cecilia S.",3,"Outdoor dining on picnic tables. Nice patio but it's right near the trash so that's not fun in July. I thought everything was a bit over cooked which is disappointing when it comes to crab legs, shrimp and mussels. King crab at $38 per lbs. (one leg for each of us) was rubbery and the ""peel and eat"" shrimp were mushy. Side order portions are a bit small so order extra if sharing. Sauces are fun. Three choices and we got all three. Medium heat is pretty hot! I recommend getting the sauces on the side because the shrimp and mussels are too smothered. It really overpowers the seafood. Fries are great and the corn is amazing. The corn and perfect house salad were probably our favorite things. Honestly, I'd go back just for that. They had just printed the new menu items that day. Thought the two house selected combo choices were lacking. They should have a ""pick 2/3"" combo option. Menu is very limited and it appears they're adding to it so that will be interesting to watch if we go back. Service was good. It's a new restaurant and you can tell by the staff. They're still getting the hang of things. More than helpful, just not smooth service. For instance, the fries were served first and <U+00A0>were pretty much gone before the food came or they would have been cold. He didn't know what drinks or salad dressings they had, etc. but he was very nice! I've been waiting for a great casual seafood restaurant to open in Cleveland, I just don't think this is it yet. They still have a few kinks so we'll see. Spent $120 for two of us and left a bit hungry and not as impressed as I hoped I would be.","188","11"
"Hana B.",3,"Went here for an early dinner, despite reading Yelp reviews, and wasn't too amazed nor too disappointed. The main problem I read about was the servers. However, when we went, the servers seemed like they were trying to correct that image. So anything that went wrong was fixed fast and when they forgot to give us snow crab initially, they gave us an extra pound of crawfish. It just seems like the employees aren't completely used to the restaurant feel yet. The food was pretty good, not crazy. Be sure to get at least medium because the spice takes the food over the edge. Don't bother with the crawfish. They're small and don't have a lot of meat. That said, the snow crab was pretty incredible. I probably wouldn't go back, but I didn't hate it. I feel like they just need a little more time to perfect their place.","34","16"
"Vy L.",3,"I had high expectations for this place and was really excited for the grand opening! The interior design is amazing, very IG worthy with great lighting, booth seats, wooden tables and a great vibe overall. As for the food, we attempted to try all the sauces and so we did; all of which were great. However, the portion size was awful for the price. Especially for the clams, which by the way we only had shells with 5-7 actual pieces to eat. The mussels were great, again, the only problem would be the portion size. As for the snow crab, it was hard to break open, with no tools besides our hands, haha. I love the fact that the place became its own, different from others especially with their creative alcohol beverages, but you are not getting your bang for your buck here.","14","53"
"Brandy A.",4,"This was a good experience for a family outing. Our server was very engaging and helpful. The food was served very hot and ready and the servings were very filling. The ambiance was very inviting. I didn't give the final star on the experience because the owner was walking through the establishment yelling about how he had someone's car towed who look likes she was a patron of his establishment. I'm sure it was an accident considering <U+00A0>we had to adjust our parking on the street as well. That touched me the wrong way","142","38"

"Tierra D.",4,"Spent one of best friends birthday at the Boiler 65 with a party of 8! Can I just start by saying the place is very nice but it could be a little bit nicer. We were sat in the front in the cut where we couldn't see anybody(don't get me wrong it felt good to have a private area but one way in and one way out ain't cool when you've had a few to drink and have to go to the bathroom and not to mention it was cold not only in our corner but even inside the main area) The waitress did an amazing job but the kitchen was super slow and I know you can't rush food but geesh a couple more cooks on a busy night might speed up service a little bit!! I'll definitely be back just with a smaller group!!","0","12"
"William B.",4,"I went here twice and the first time I would have gave this place a 3 at best. However the second time the food was so <U+00A0>much better it would be a 5. The first time I went it was later on a Saturday night <U+00A0>around 10pm. The food had great flavor but the corn was very chewy, the potatoes and shrimp were also over cooked and not easy to eat. I decided to give it a second chance because the flavor was good, this time I went earlier about an hour after they opened. Turned out to be a good decision the food came out great.","32","1"
"Geneva A.",4,"We ordered the shrimp with out heads, mussels and corn. <U+00A0>Everything was good but the mussels had all fallen out the shells so we had to fish them out of the sauce in the steam bag. <U+00A0>Glad they bring you gloves because you need it for this meal. <U+00A0>Wish my waitress filled my water a little better because the food was a little spicer than expect(not a bad thing if I had water). <U+00A0>The menu is very limited, wish they had something like cornbread.","12","104"

"Kaylyn B.",4,"I was in the mood for seafood, and having family who lives in the south, I love a good seafood boil. I was leery about coming here, because the reviews haven't been stellar, but I'm definitely glad we gave it a try, and we will definitely be back!As I said, I have family down near Savannah and Charleston, and they don't mess around with their low country boils. Well, the food at Boiler 65 lived up to my high expectations! It was all very fresh and very delicious. My husband and I split the duo bag with the Bomb Diggity sauce, and it was the perfect amount of food (we even had some leftovers!). I thought the price was fair for as much as we got. I do wish, however, that there were an easier way to ""build a bag"" as an individual. For example, instead of everything coming in full pounds, make them half pounds so you can mix and match. If you're coming with another person, though, the duo bag is the way to go! Three pounds of seafood with potatoes, corn, and sausage--YUM! Be ready to get messy: no plates or silverware here, but that makes it more fun, IMO!As excellent as the food was, one star had to come off for a couple reasons. First, there was a distinct lack of hustle among the employees. The table next to us had piles and piles of old shells and trash sitting on it for at least ten minutes after we arrived--not the most appetizing thing to look at. Multiple workers were standing around and the restaurant wasn't busy, so this could have and should have been taken care of sooner. However, our server, Renee, was awesome and attentive. The other negative: the drink prices. Guys, this isn't New York City. A bottle of Rolling Rock should not cost $5.50. It's Rolling Rock. And my cocktail, while delicious, was $10; the same cocktail anywhere nearby would go for $7 or $8. Bring the drink prices down, teach your workers that there's always work to be done, and by golly, give me a fork to fish out the clams from the bottom of my bag and you've got a 5 star place!","3","31"
"Miles R.",4,"Wanted to try a pound of crawfish late Sunday afternoon. To my disappointment, our waiter Tarik returned to tell us that they had run out of crawfish and their shipment wouldn't be in until Monday. Ordered the calamari and the 2 piece catfish dinner which came with cajun fries, hush puppies, and cole slaw. <U+00A0> Everything was flavorful, plentiful and prepared well. <U+00A0>Liked the cornmeal coating that made it crunchy. <U+00A0>Only the slaw lacked flavor. The service was very good. Tarik made sure our glasses stayed filled and checked on us periodically to see if we needed anything <U+00A0>and were doing ok. Enjoyed it overall and will definitely return. <U+00A0>Only disappointed by the absence of the crawfish. Have to question why a restaurant whose specialty is based on the seafood boil would run short on one of its main menu items... I asked Tarik to convey our disappointment to his manager. He said he did so...we were told his manager conveyed his apologies and the crawfish would be in the following day. <U+00A0>Hmmm. Is it me or was I expecting too much to have had the manager come out to express that sentiment? <U+00A0>We'll try again another time. Definitely worth second visit.","5","28"
"Stephanie N.",4,"Really loved the concept and atmosphere of the place and the food was good. Dress in stuff you don't care if it gets butter or grease good eats and worth working for it. My hubby who always says he's not going to a restaurant and working for his food but he was really surprised. Bottom line we would go back. Other than that you pick your seafood we did the duo thingy and made a switch which was an up charge. If you wanted the heads removed from the shrimp it's an up charge we opted to leave the heads on. Than you picked the heat mild Med hot fire our waitress told us if we went with med and it wasn't hot enough she could bring us hotter stuff didn't mention an up charge for that. She came back to the table when we were 3/4 done and I asked for a little more sauce with heat came back with a foam cup of not sure some hotter broth. We cleaned up bill came and we had an up charge for having heads removed which we didn't request and told her that when the food was delivered. She very nicely took care of those two things and smiled at the end. I'm sure it wasn't easy asking her boss to remove 7.00 from the bill. All in all we're definitely going back.","67","59"
"Chrishana B.",4,"I love that this restaurant is nestled in my neighborhood and it's such a great edition!This is a great restaurant for a first date or a night out with your friends. Unlike some of the reviews I read, the service was great...The staff were very professional and helpful and everyone was always ready to help serve. Now onto what really matters. THE FOOD! My friend and I ordered the go butter sauce crab legs with medium spice, the bomb diggity crab legs with medium spice, and corn and potatoes. They definitely didn't taste like they were seasoned with Old Bay and butter sauce was our favorite! They give you a bib and buckets to chow down. It was a full house of people and they had the doors open to the outside for a great breeze while we ate. They serve adult capris of booze filled drinks, although their alcohol selection is very limited. The food is inexpensive and average priced for seafood like this, so you for value it's as good as it gets. If your a seafood lover then this place is worth a try!","81","101"
"Renee C.",4,"This was a terrific experience and a delicious meal. Mom and I were surprised by the open layout and charmed by the attentive waitstaff. This a a different concept and we didn't know what to expect. We chose King Crab, mussels, clams, corn and potatoes. We had fun choosing the spice level and then the sauce. We put on our bib and gloves (yes, gloves!) when the food came and had a blast digging into the bucket! Highly recommend the OG butter sauce. The crab was sensational and the rest of the meal followed suit. Congrats to Team Ny and family on what is sure to be a stunning success! Thanks for a wonderful night. By the way, this is a brand new enterprise, so diners should keep expectations for timing right sized.","4","2"

"Meg K.",5,"This was our (my husband and I) first time checking out The Boiler 65, after months of waiting for it to open. It was AMAZING. We got the catfish nuggets - which were EXCELLENT. Perfect cornmeal crunch, soft tender fish, and a remoulade that I had to get a second cup of it was so fucking good. Also got the Cajun fries - which have THE BEST seasoning, warm and spicy, with the *slightest* hint of sweet. Main course: 1 pound of heads off peel & eat shrimp with corn on the cob - medium spice, in the O.G. Butter sauce. It was *life affirming*. That sauce is where it's at. And those shrimp were so sweet and tender and delicious. I was in heaven. After eating everything, it was all too tempting to sprawl out in the big, private green leather booth to catch a little nap... I resisted the urge, though... thinking maybe the other patrons might give me side eye. <U+00A0>For all the uppity folks complaining about paper table cloths and no silverware, etc, etc - LIVE A LITTLE, PEOPLE. Good food is fucking messy, and the BEST food is eaten with your hands. It's a carnal, beautiful thing. You should give it a try.End note: the staff was friendly and accommodating, made sure we were happy, asked about the food, they're genuine. And the music is awesome, too. I know we will absolutely be back to this amazing place. Love to the chefs who made our impromptu night out this evening truly delicious. You guys are the real deal.","1","12"
"Steven K.",5,"We had a pound of OG shrimp, Cajun fries and catfish bites. <U+00A0>Holy shit this place is amazing!!! It's also reasonably priced. <U+00A0>It's a messy meal, so if you're uppity, you'd better head back to the suburbs.","4","57"
"Srey B.",5,"Best seafood in Cleveland. Great atmosphere. Great drinks. Try the bombdiggity with og butter sauce mixed together.","29","5"
"Annie B.",5,"We thoroughly enjoyed Boiler 65. <U+00A0>We had such a fun experience and loved the food. Robin was a phenomenal server who explained everything so well and gave us the perfect amount of attention. It was the first time my friend ever had crawfish and one of the owners gave us a great lesson on how to beat eat them. We shared the duo which was the perfect amount of food and love the mint juleps. I'm already raving about this to friends and can't wait to go again!","3","2"
"Audrey K.",5,"Just had a great experience for dinner with my family at the broiler 65. The menu is small and contains mostly seafood except for some appetizers so if you have allergies to seafood/shellfish you might want to stay away. But for the lucky ones who can eat seafood, it is a great time. The food was excellent. I just spent a weekend in Maryland a few weeks ago and had A LOT of crab and I was surprised to find that the crab legs we had here were even better! The staff was friendly, nice and very attentive. I would recommend for a fun night out, just maybe not for a first date because it can get a little messy","70","24"
"Michael K.",5,"Without a doubt one of the best new restaurants in Cleveland. This is one of the best quality seafood boils you will find north of the Mason-Dixon line. Our food was hot, our drinks were cold, and our service was terrific. If you like seafood, you have to come here! We will be back many, many times!","11","3"
"Rosie D.",5,"I'm from Rhode Island i regularly come to CLE to visit my sister who just recently moved here and EVERY TIME I come to CLE my number one plan is to try this restaurant, we have nothing like this back home. So out of a handful of times I've visited I haven't had time to carry out my plan of trying this place. I'm so glad I did. Let's just say these people turned my frown upside down no lie! I had just landed in CLE AND SOUTHWEST LOST MY LUGGAGE. So I was having the worst day. I sat at the bar the staff were so tentative, they regularly checked on me. <U+00A0>This place was so clean and spacious seeing you need a lot of elbow room to eat. The owner was so hospitable I witnessed him walking up to the other tables checking on his guest. I ordered a cocktail and before I could finish my cocktail my food came out; in other words I didn't have a long wait :) I ordered clams, lobster tail, and potatoes with mild bomb digity sauce. LISTENNNN good is a understatement.... the food was GREAT! The owner suggested the corn and sausage so I can have the full experience of a boil so I did and I'm so glad I did because it was amazing. I never take the time to participate in yelp but this place earned my time to do so! And I will for sure be going back with my sister before I leave so she can try it..I'm sure she'll love it! I'm so mad I didn't take a pic but I'll be sure to take one next time :)","0","4"
"Carole B.",5,"Very hip Cajun seafood boil type restaurant not far from Ohio City. I had the fried lobster tail and snow crab legs to go. I have to chow down on crab legs in the comfort of my own home. Everything was tasty and delicious. I forgot to take pics, sorry!","8","57"
"Caple N.",5,"I truly enjoyed this dish here!! The way the spices and texture of the lobster tail was AMAZING!!! I would go back and have it again, but I had my <U+00A0>on another dish.","30","8"
"Monet E.",5,"Picture a place with Cajun seafood that can out do cajuns at seafood <U+00A0>that's the Boiler 65! My first experience here was nothing short of amazing. The boiled twin lobster tails with OG Butter sauce were flavorful, hot and cooked very well. I paired that with corn and potatoes and beef sausage. The restaurant is pretty large and there's plenty of seating. They also have a nice patio if you like to eat outside. Seating at the bar is also an option.","14","39"
"John P.",5,"What a wonderful restaurant and an even greater owner! His name is Teem (hope I have spelled it correctly) and he takes pride in the business because he was born and raised in the neighborhood. It takes alot of confidence to start up a business and alot of risk. Teem is up to the challenge! Now, about the food.... absolutely delish . We had the pot of crab legs, shrimp and crawfish, with the butter sauce. It was so good we ordered another pound of shrimp. Table next to us ordered the corn on the cob. It looked super delish and the people loved it. The restaurant has a ""cool vibe"" about it, the painted cement floors are ""on point"". Wait staff was very friendly and efficient. Join me in welcoming a new restaurant to the neighborhood from our Hometown Son !!!!","0","11"
"Gregory L.",5,"I had a very nice experience here the duo bag was more than enough to fill me up and I'm a big guy also everything was cooked to perfection. When you come make sure you ask for Paige her service was great, very funny and knowledgeable about the menu she will point you in the right direction rather it's your first or tenth time coming here to eat.","0","1"
"Carri R.",5,"I found my new favorite restaurant! Best clams ever & definitely the best crab legs in the city! The food was fantastic! Drinks were delicious & fun. We had the hurricane which came in a Capri Sun type bag & the Mule that came out ""smoking"" with dry ice. Great atmosphere & service. Be prepared to wait a few minutes for the food, but it is cooked to order so worth the wait. The food was pretty inexpensive for what you get too. We had the chance to talk with one of the owners. Team NY. Great guy. <U+00A0>...and an added bonus to know that we were patronizing an business owned by people that grew up in the neighborhood. If you like seafood you have to give this place a try!","24","18"
"Aris F.",5,"Man this place is awesome. Obviously, its a new spot and there feeling their way around running a restaurant but the food is on point! Got to meet the owner, what a great guy! They're very passionate about this place and you can tell from the quality of the food!","1","16"
"Armanyy G.",5,"This place is amazing.. <U+00A0>Dominique the server was amazing. <U+00A0>I'm coming back every day. For sure. Loved this place she was very professional. And she made my experience here great","0","3"
"Michael S.",5,"What a great place. A bit of Louisiana in CLE. Love the open floor plan. Seating is comfortable and cool. Service was fantastic. Quick, attentive and friendly. Now for the food. The catfish nuggets offered the perfect start. Tangy and tasty. A great Cajun like spice added to crawfish and shrimp included corn and sausage. A lot of fun with a good selection of beverage. Will be back to this great addition to CLE.","1","33"
"Erica L.",5,"We went here last night for my birthday celebration and was blown away! I went to school in the south and have been looking for a good place for crawfish boils in Cleveland - I finally found the spot!! We got the Duo Bag with snow crab, crawfish, shrimp, sausage, corn and potatoes in the Bomb Diggity sauce in medium and oh. my. gosh. I am already craving this meal again!! Not to mention, their Crab Island adult capri sun drink was delicious too!Our server, Dominique, was very attentive and nice. As well as Team who stopped by to make sure everything was good for us. My only suggestion would be to have servers or signage on each table that would help newcomers get familiar with the concept and make sure people know what they're supposed to do (crawfish peeling is tough without proper instruction!). I can understand why people may be initially uncomfortable with the boiling seafood concept if they've never had it, but with some more guidance I think everyone would be leaving happy! This is easily my new favorite restaurant in Cleveland.","196","30"
"J'ette N.",5,"Not in love with the concept. The prices could be lower. The whole system is new and fresh and extremely awkward. The food can be really, really good. The service is always genuinely good-hearted and sincere.The vibe is quite brilliant.So i recommend The Boiler 65... on the merit of it being something new and brilliant and not yet formed ... but really, really good.","103","18"
"Kaylie T.",5,"They went above and beyond for us!I'm not sure why they got some bad reviews regarding their service because this was far from true for us.I'm originally from Orange County, CA...where there are crawfish joints everywhere. So when one opens up near me..I have to check it out. Even if it means having to take my 1 yr old to a restaurant where you eat with your hands. This is where they totally exceeded my expectation with their service.Renee, our server went out of her way to help me with my baby. When my kid was fussy she offered crayons. There was nothing on the menu for my baby and I thought I came prepared, but she didnt want to eat the food I packed her. Of course she wanted what I was eating. Well the restaurant made my baby her own plain corn with no seasoning. And they gave us 2 just in case she decided she wanted to throw one off her high chair, which she did of course. When we finished our meal, a gentleman who I assume is the owner, came by to ask us about our experience. They clearly care enough to ask for feedback from their patrons.As for the food..its good! It was a tad pricier than joints in CA, but hey I'm not complaining. I'm just happy they opened up and its a short drive to get my crawfish fix! I'll be back again for sure but next time I'll plan for a babysitter.","0","16"
"Olivia H.",5,"I grew up on the Gulf Coast and I miss the crawfish boils and delicious, well-seasoned seafood. After basically giving up on finding good Cajun food in Cleveland, particularly crawfish, I am so happy that this place has opened.Went there on 7/7/17, and they said they've been open for a couple weeks. They're clearly still figuring things out. Our waitress let us know that they're still seeing what's popular before they put together combo meals, and that one of the mixed drinks wasn't being made anymore because it hadn't gotten a good reception. I thought the food was hands-down delicious, and I appreciate them being critical enough of themselves to be in a period of morphing their menu toward what the customer enjoys.Their format now is you choose your seafood by the pound, a sauce, a spiciness level, and any sides. It all gets cooked in a bag to make a big bag of deliciousness. We got shrimp, mussels, crawfish, corn, and potatoes with hot bomb diggity sauce. Definitely a delicious and fun meal. Overall, the experience, service, food, and drinks were all great. Can't wait go to back.","0","9"
"Ali S.",5,"I visited this restaurant on a Friday evening with my boyfriend and we both had a wonderful experience. The staff was very attentive and we were immediately sat. We chose to sit at the bar and our bartender was very personable and made us both the wonderful capri sun style drinks. We ordered calamari, the crab legs, sausage and shrimp. The sausage was AMAZING as were the crab legs. You get a good amount of food relative to price. The place is clean, well lit, and has great decor. I think it is in a great location and a rare restaurant in Cleveland. I would definitely go back! If you had a bad experience, give the place a chance, all new restaurants go through ups and downs but Cleveland deserves a boiling seafood restaurant!","132","7"
"Sam B.",5,"We got a pound of clams and some sides. The clams were covered in a delicious sauce (the third option, forget what it's called). Unfortunately, many of the shells were empty. Upon complaining we received excellent service- drinks on the house and beautiful conversation with the cook, Team Ny <U+00A0>(his real name -- ask him about it.) Stop in, it's a comfortable place with innovative food. (But maybe avoid the clams, hah)","2","2"
