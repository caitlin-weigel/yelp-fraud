"1","This used to be one of my favorite local spots for breakfast but sadly the service is not what it used to be. Was seated and given coffee by the greeter at 11:23am and literally not one waitstaff stopped at my table until 23 minutes later and it was not busy. I literally had to flag down the greeter who seated me to tell him not one person stopped at my table all awhile they took orders from three other tables around me that came in afterwards, and I see other waitstaff talking, laughing and watching TV. Greeter took my order and I asked for the manager who even took his time coming out. At this point, I told the greeter to just cancel my order and charge me for the coffee. I'm not sticking around. My breakfast was ruined due to the lousy service. If there was a way I could place my order directly with the cooks and retrieve my food  and completely eliminate  any interaction with the waitstaff, I would... They absolutely suck. I hope the YT staff reads this message and GYST!"
"2","I love YT restaurants in general but after the experience I had last night at this branch, I will not go back until the manager that worked last night is fired. I specifically asked about a certain dish based on the photo in the menu. I needed to know because my gut will have major problems if I have gluten. I was assured by the waiter that it was not battered. What came out was was battered chicken fingers and not the chicken wings I ordered. I was then told that they didn't have chicken wings and walked away without asking me if I wanted anything else. We had already waited 20 or so min for the food to be delivered after ordering and the sandwich I ordered (with gluten free bread) to go with the wings was already only luke warm by that point. I ate the sandwich. The waiter returned when I was halfway done with the sandwich and then asked if I wanted anything instead. By that time i wasn't about to wait another 20 min for another entree. The waiter was very nice and simply made a mistake. I was willing to let this all go but then this happened. The waiter came by with this electronic pad for payment. When I went to select my tip, I noticed the tip amounts were dollars more than what the tip percentages should have been. I pointed it out to the waiter and he was surprised and went to get the manager. The manager came over and said ""what's the problem here?""  I thought the waiter would have told him about the tip percentages being wrong. I showed him my bill and told him that a 20% tip based on my bill would be x amount. And then showed him the device and the tip amount it shows for 20%. Much more. He grumbled words I didn't understand and took the device and started punching stuff in it. I asked him if it was basing the tip amounts on the original figure from before they took off the chicken wings. He looked at me and said we don't sell them here. I told him that I had specifically asked about them and was assured that you did and that nothing was battered because of the gluten intolerance. He wouldn't even look at me and he kept doing stuff with the device. Then he put the device in front of me and said type in what you want to give for a tip. I typed in $3. He said to me, ""is that all?"" I said that's more than 20% but he puts my new receipt down with the tip added into the original amount and no pen to sign, turned around and walked away as fast as possible. Next thing I know, I get an alert on my phone as I always do when I'm at a restaurant or store and purchase something. The amount is $4+ more than the total with the tip. Normally it goes through initially for the amount without the tip and the tip shows up during final processing. I couldn't believe his treatment of me to start with but this was too much. I brought my receipts and phone up to him at the register and asked him why he charged me over $4 more than my total with tip. He said he charged me correctly. I said that my bank charge says otherwise and try to show him. He refuses to look at it and said that he put it in correctly and nothing went through yet. I said it obviously did go through because it's already been charged to my account. He said the correct amount will show up at 4:30 am when the bulk processing happens. I asked him how the wrong amount showed up on my account if he put in the correct amount. He just said the correct amount will show up at 4:30 am. At this point, there was no point in discussing the matter with him any further. I told him it had better be correct and that this has been the worst experience. He never looked at me or apologized.  Mind you, this morning the amount on my bank is still incorrect. This manager has committed fraud and is one of the worst restaurant managers ever. I tend to tip 20-30% based on service. Despite the error the waiter made he was still a good waiter in every other way. His tip was more than 25% based on the total. However, charging me an additional $4+ for what, I don't know, was fraud and that I will not tolerate on any level."
"3","This restaurant is not staffed appropriately to handle the customers.  The server was completely apologetic and hardworking but the length of time it took to be properly seated and served was unacceptable.  The food was good but the service was way too slow."
"4","The service was nice and amicable. The food is a different matter. Of the two items that were ordered, one was foamy and runny for a breakfast burritos. The other had hair in the eggs and one the ham."
"5","I can't tell you about the food... I didn't get waited on! I only recommend NOT to go to this one in Shaker Square."
"6","The food was good. Understaffed beyond belief! Servers running around like crazy, food taking forever to come out of the kitchen (can't really be the servers fault because the orders are being sent in from the handheld device at the table). We split our group in two because the wait was so long, and one table got food 25 minutes before the other, both ordered at the same time.From the sound of it, this is a normal occurrence when they get busy. If they are anywhere close to full, you might want to pick somewhere else."
"7","This restaurant is not staffed appropriately to handle the customers.  The server was completely apologetic and hardworking but the length of time it took to be properly seated and served was unacceptable.  The food was good but the service was way too slow."
"8","I had the kill it skillet, bad for me, but filling and pretty good.  The service was fine.  Go here when you want an old style breakfast any time of the day."
"9","Terrible.  Writing this review while I wait.Husband and I ordered our food at 6:30pm.  Wings, salad, naked tenders, Mac n cheese came out at 7:10.  Immediately I knew that the naked tenders were not ""naked"" and grilled.  They were breaded and fried and someone scraped off the breading but left half of it on the plate.  Our server took it back and said she was sorry.  14 minutes later still waiting. No apology from management.  My husband is done eating while my 15 month old and I are still waiting.  This place is absolutely terrible!"
"10","Terrible! Check out the first picture in my profile of staff and management standing around watching tv! Shameful lazy! 1. Slow service 2. Cold food (wings covered in cold sauce) (burgers and fries cold) burgers dry thin party terrible! 3. MANAGEMENT AWFUL - the two hours we were stuck at this horrible location we watched management along with several other staff just stand at the entrance area watching varies sports on TV. No help to staff - never checked on any tables. Clearly not managing the food coming out of the kitchen. Just standing there watching TV. This is the second experience at this location and certainly the last. Place is not busy if you feel like sitting alone but that will not speed up service or quality of food. Corporate compare your revenues to that of other locations. I'm sure the numbers match this poor review."
"11","Let's start with the housekeeping isn't the greatest.  My waitress then punched in my order wrong.  Finally got that corrected.  They only carry the pink sweetener.  When my new wings come out one is the wrong dry rub.  I've been waiting for about 10 minutes now.  We had to ask three times for napkins. My coworker and I ordered carrots and celery.  Had to ask for those 4 times.  When the manager dropped them off he just put them on the table and walked away.  My waitress just came to my table and asked if I wanted the bill.  No.  I want my freaking wings.  This place is a disaster and should be avoided at all costs."
"12","So I am a regular Bdubs customer. As an NCAA coach, I like my wings and sports. I was recently hired at a nearby NCAA college and on my second day here I decided to go to Bdubs. So a few things to point out....1. The bartender was very friendly. He as a male bartender. I don't remember his name. 2. The baseball wild card game was on. I asked if they can turn down the music and put on the sound of the game. They did it. And then the bartender started talking sports with us. He knew his stuff. That was excellent.3. Food was warm and good. Beer was good. No complaints there!So went to another Bdubs in the area and didn't like that one as much so I will be coming here as my first choice for Bdubs."
"13","The worst service. Been here before and every time it is awful. No one cares about service. They ignore you and talk to each other. I only come back out of desperation. And always have awful service."
"14","Stopped to grab a quick bite and watch a baseball game back in August. Terrible experience. Out of three of the draft beers listed on the menu, on a slow mid-week day too! So the waitress suggested a ""special"" draft. Also out. My husband finally got one after several more tries. I ordered a coffee, and after a shocked look from the server it finally arrived in a paper cup with a pint of milk on the side. No creamer or 1/2 and 1/2."
"15","Service around 7 on a slow Saturday night.   Got wings boneless with mild and buffalo chips. Wings were great I got cheese on chips and that was not as good.Service was not great. Server was very pleasant but had to ask for serve ware and never got beverage refills. Choose carry out if you can."
"16","I placed an online order that was to be ready at 6:10 I arrived at 6:03pm and paid for my order. While waiting I placed another order for fried mushrooms. It is now 6:52 and I was presented with the mushrooms but not my original order!! The server finally retrieved my food and what do you know, it's been sitting and is now cold. I asked to speak to the manager and his response was ""oh I bagged this a long time ago"" there are TWO workers doing the takeout window.. and they are blaming each other for my order not being ready... the manager says ""I wish they would do away with the online ordering because it's not accurate"" it's 2018!!!! How is your online ordering not accurate??? Not to mention it was clearly ready and just never brought up front. Ridiculous and I will never order here again.. going on 7pm and I'm waiting on  a FRESH order. Not to mention I've watched 2 other people leave and come back with messed up orders.. it's chicken and fries people.. oh and while waiting I got to witness a lovely screaming match between two servers in the back.. real professional"
"17","Some of the slowest service I've ever had.Nice server, who you'd think was totally in the weeds, yet the place was boringly quiet. I'll say half full.When we came to pay, we did pay separately, I know, not something I normally recommend.But then it took fifteen to twenty minutes to pay someone, anyone.I'm not going to say its the worst service, or something like, ""I'll never be back.""Bit its not going to be a pick of mine.Just try harder, actually, just try."
"18","I've been to Lake Orion, Mi and Rochester, Mi locations once each and had an excellent time at both.  I'd give 5 stars except the following experience. This was the location in Beachwood, Ohio. Food was yummy. Service varied from ignorant to ok. We, a friend, myself and my toddler, entered with a couple in front of us.  We stood there for several minutes. A man who appeared to be the manager returned twice to the hostess, each time having a long conversation about seating. The restaurant was basically empty. The hostess never even looked at us. Finally, during the second conversation I interrupted to say how long we'd waited and could they seat us. The hostess mumbled something about thinking we were with a group. I really hate having to get pushy to get a normal level of service. After that the service from the waitress was acceptable.  She was definitely struggling to serve a pretty slow section. The hostess and carry out staff continued to carry on conversations instead of doing some work.  Management at this location needs to step it up with hiring. The staff was really low quality for this kind of place."
"19","Terrible.  Writing this review while I wait.Husband and I ordered our food at 6:30pm.  Wings, salad, naked tenders, Mac n cheese came out at 7:10.  Immediately I knew that the naked tenders were not ""naked"" and grilled.  They were breaded and fried and someone scraped off the breading but left half of it on the plate.  Our server took it back and said she was sorry.  14 minutes later still waiting. No apology from management.  My husband is done eating while my 15 month old and I are still waiting.  This place is absolutely terrible!"
"20","My colleague and I grab wings from here once a month around 1 and I have no major complaints. There is usually (when we visit) only a few people dining in but the service is still somewhat slow. However, the food is hot and good so I'll take that over slow and cold any day. The staff is nice and one of the cooks introduced me to the salt n vinegar rub wings...surprisingly good."
"21","I ordered Parmesan garlic wings and received a box of sauce with wings in it. Definitely don't like to dine at places that don't appear to care about my food."
"22","This is only my second time at this location and will be my last. On wing night they only had two servers and one was training another, servicing the entire place. It took 5-10 minutes just to be seated even with management walking past the line of us needing to be seated. It was quickly decided to order drinks and food together so we wouldn't have to wait forever. Thankfully the food was hot and came out fairly quick but no refills on drinks etc as again they were taking care of the whole restaurant. Not blaming the servers, I just believe that if management cared enough or focused on service this location wouldn't be such a terrible place."
"23","Service here is always extremely slow. The employees don't care about providing good service. It once took me an hour to receive a takeout order for their nachos, and the restaurant wasn't even busy. I could deal with the slow service in exchange for some decent food, but I got food poisoning after my most recent visit. Won't be coming back here for a long time, if at all."
"24","I like Buffalo Wild Wings food okay, they're wings are pretty good. To be honest I think I could find cheaper elsewhere that are also better. Went with a group of 5, it must've taken them over half an hour to bring our food out. Either way, we were there for almost two hours and it did not take us long to eat wings. I got the Nacho burger with fries, the fries were classic fries, crispy and right amount of saltiness. Burger was pretty good too, nothing special. I got bone-in dry rub chipotle barbecue wings, the chicken wasn't very tender but the seasoning was great, very flavorful, slightly spicy, just a hint of barbecue. Our waitress came pretty scarcely to our table, we had to flag down a busser to get our water refilled, and that was like an hour into our time there. Mostly rating two stars for minimal service, the time t took for our food to cook and I'd expect better for the price."
"25","Seriously, when I got to Buffalo Wild Wings almost at the end of the first quarter of the season opener, I was on bar number three. The first bar didn't have NFL Sunday Ticket so I could only watch the browns. The second bar was so packed that there wasn't anywhere to go and no servers offered any help or drinks, so we bailed. Finally, Buffalo peeps flailing around in Cleveland, we remembered that there was a new Buffalo Wild Wings where that terrible dance club/bar that was always empty used to be.Wild Wings was expectedly crowded, but there was room to stand in the bar area and we eventually got a table. They have tons of TVs and we were able to easily watch the Browns put up a good fight, the Bills pull out a win, and Miami make Tom Brady cry.This is a pretty standard Wild Wings. The food we ordered was fine and our waitress was great. They were even raffling off a Browns jersey. Our waitress joked that she wasn't sure whether to offer the free tickets to the Pittsburgh table (they were playing the Browns) so I suggested that she tell them that after the Browns beat them, they could use the jersey to wipe away their tears... Too bad Pittsburgh stole the win on a drive in the final seconds of the game.Overall, definitely a good place to watch the games on Sunday. Sad that the places closer to me aren't good choices, but I'll drive up here to watch."
"26","I've never been to an Olive Garden and never will because unlike some people I know the difference between good food and some thing that was cooked up and shipped from Mexico.  They probably have rabbit instead of chicken and the people they call chefs probably walked over from their job at the nearest Taco Bell.  I'm sorry if you like this place but it's obvious that you mistook this place for a Chipotle."
"27","Ordered the steak Gorgonzola, eating my food only to find someone's disgusting finger nail in there. Not to mention your standing waiting forever to be serviced when two girls are right by the front chatting it up paying no attention to the customers waiting to place a hold for their seat. I will make the drive out to the one on Parma from here on."
"28","Terrible. The meat sauce was absolutely tasteless. The meatballs were just, not worth any amount of money. They are literally just a ball of beef that's been boiled. It's sooo bad. If Olive Garden wants to rebrand they should focus on keeping all of their branches on the same page."
"29","Worst Olive Garden experience ever.Tasteless food. The bartender was friendly but so busy that it was hard to get any service. One server was leaning backwards in the bar window and his dreads were nearly in some kid's apple juice. Gross."
"30","Never again. First, the servers do not know how to serve and need to be trained or maybe just care. Second, my knife was filthy and so i asked the server (Nadia G.) for another set. She brought it after i asked a second time. My party and I started off with the stuffed mushrooms and calamari. The mushrooms nearly burnt our mouths from being intensely hot inside. I had the carbonara dish with shrimp and chicken and again my dish with speghetti was piping hot. Speghetti is never piping hot unless it's nuked. The shrimp was very tight because it was nuked also. This took some of the taste away. It was not good. Besides that it was very overpriced. I asked our server how much because the description was not on the menu and she stated $16 and change. When I got the check it was $2 higher.My friend had eggplant parmigiana and he also said he could tell it was nuked. I ordered iced tea with my meal. The server told us we could pay by using the pay yourself option that's on the table but never came back to ask us if we wanted to do that option. After she brought our entrees she disappeared. Never asked me if I wanted a refill of tea or to give us our checks and left our dirty dishes on the table for 45 minutes until I asked someone else if the table could be cleared. We asked for the mgr and informed her of the blazing hot food and we knew it had been nuked and also why our dirty dishes were left in front of us. She apologized and comped us the entrees and kindly asked if we wanted dessert but we passed. When paying the check our server gave my friend about 75 cents too much and shorted me my 58 cent change.  I think she was too lazy to want to count it out. I will never eat here again."
"31","If I could give negative stars I would.   We did the call ahead seating so our wait time was only 5 minutes.  We then sat for 15 minutes before the waitress came over to great us.   We had our full order in at that time.  10 minutes later so got our waters.  10 minutes after that, we got our salads.  15 minutes later, my date got his appetizer.  Another 25 minutes after that, our entrees showed up.  We've been waiting on our check for 15 minutes now. If you're ever waiting at this Olive Garden, it's because the service is lousy.  The food was excellent."
"32","Dirty, staff is unmotivated and poorly trained. Wait for tables too long with many people seated ahead of my party despite them arriving after. Response to complaints to management was half hearted and poorly executed.The food is sub par - never going to this or any of the others again."
"33","Came at 4 o clock with husband and 2 kids. Was told I'd have to wait 15 minutes because theu didn't have enough servers. Although there were 7 people standing behind the welcome counter. Only 2 tables had guest.they were slow. Took over 8 minutes to get water to the table. Window seal covered in dust. Waitress was polite and friendly. Fair prices. Good food."
"34","Terrible experience waited an hour with horrible service.  Receptionist was rude and lied constantly to customers."
"35","What a sad place to have dinner!  This place is by far is the worst establishment I have been to.  The food was standard like in all Olive Gardens,  but the service was just terrible.   They ignored my  reservation, brought wrong wine ( more expensive, of course), brought wrong food, zero apologies.  The manager chickened and didn't come to the table when  asked.  Stay away from this location is my advice."
"36","So I'll start off with the negative...the service was not that great. The waiter took forever to come to our table for drinks and breadsticks. So don't go when you're hungry because it's a wait. Other than that I loved the food! Their breadsticks are always warm and fresh. I also had their gnocchi soup which never fails to please me. I created my own pasta. I was very pleased they had whole grain pasta on the menu. So I had whole grain pasta and their parmesan pesto sauce with 2 Italian sausage links. It was a nice meal but as I said before it would have been nice if the server was around more."
"37","Nearly every time I visit Olive Garden's Harvard Park location, the bartender allows dirty dishes to accumulate, and linger on the bar for long periods of time. I sat at the bar for almost an hour, and saw no effort being made to clean off the bar.  The restaurant wasn't even busy. Apparently, keeping a clean bar is not a priority to any of the bartenders at this location, as I've witnessed this problem for years."
"38","Worst Olive Garden experience ever.Tasteless food. The bartender was friendly but so busy that it was hard to get any service. One server was leaning backwards in the bar window and his dreads were nearly in some kid's apple juice. Gross."

"40","I go to Panera Bread often because I know what they serve and that it will be consistent. Usually they have very nice staff. Not this Panera. I was the only person in line and the staff was lackadaisical at best. When my coffee came up, they said they called my name I sure didn't hear them, but they never repeated it. They were not busy with customers. The apathy put me off. The egg sandwich was runny all down my shirt. When an egg sandwich is ordered one expects it to be done so it doesn't run all over your clothes. Poor customer service."
"41","I love Panera, but not this one. If you want to use the catering service select a different cafe. Each and every time I ordered catering there was an issue and I order catering often. I usually write lengthy reviews but I refuse to spend a significant amount of time on this store. It's my hopes that someone will hear the complaints of your customers and get this store and it's manager some serious training. For now, I use the Panera on Cedar Rd. and have had no issues. I suggest any catering customers do the same."
"42","This particular Panera branch is absolutely horrid. I ordered a simple bagel with cream cheese, sliced and toasted. When I got my bagel, the top portion had been sliced so thin (literally, it was 1-2cm thick) that it burned to the consistency of a potato chip. When I inquired about possibly getting a new bagel, the individual behind the counter said ""no,"" and that it was ""your fault for ordering it toasted."" Wtf? On a separate visit with my family, the soups and mac n cheese we ordered ranged from  lukewarm to bone cold. When we took them back to the counter, we were instructed to use the microwave located near the napkin dispenser. Again, wtf??! AVOID this Panera Bread like the plague. It's most certainly not up to the par of other Panera locations.EDIT: I've called corporate regarding my above experiences, and was informed that I was not the first person to complain about this particular branch. Just an FYI."
"43","Do not go to this Panera Bread, the service is absolutely ridiculous. Every single time I go there my order is messed up. Today they gave me two different sandwiches and still did not get it correct. Don't waste your money and save yourself a headache, they should be out of business. The last time my order was messed up I called and was lied to by an employee who told me they were a manager. He then continued to call me vulgar names, the GM didn't seem to care about this."
"44","One and done.Got a tuna sandwich and it was bland. Bread was basically hardtack. The lemonade was pretty good. Service was, to be kind, a tire fire. Place was generally dirty. Layout makes no sense either. Basically you wait in line forever, get rude service, walk around the corner, wait forever, and hopefully recognize your order."
"45","Don't expect much from this location. We just ordered a fair amount of food at a hefty price and almost every order was messed up. We did the online ordering and things were clearly omitted, however, found their way onto every order and paid for items that were not included. Also the poor attitude of whomever answered to phone when we called to check if the order was ready, was completely uncalled for. If you like salty attitudes, your order wrong and paying for things you don't get, this is the place for you. But if you want decent service and  getting what you order avoid this location!!"
"46","Had food catered by this Panera location for a meeting I was hosting at my job. Delivery driver spilled half of the soups that we ordered in the parking lot. When asked about getting the money for the spilled soups refunded, we were instructed to call the Panera directly. Called them and got the run around about getting a refund because they wanted the card number again. It was a company card that our director was in possession of, and he wasn't in the office; so I waited until the following day to call back.When I called the following day I was made to feel like I was being less than reasonable for wanting a refund for the spilled soup. The lady brought up how it spilled in transit. I felt bad for the delivery driver; but that doesn't change the fact that we ended up short on soup for half of our guests. I also advised the lady that we did not receive baguettes for the soup we ordered. She told me they were packed in the bag (which they weren't) and proceeded to try to explain what a baguette was as if I didn't know. At that point, I was over it, and I asked for a refund for the spilled soup as well as the $20 tip charged to the card prior to service. She seemed surprised, possibly even insulted. I'm not saying accidents don't happen, but what ever happened to taking the initiative to make things right when a paying customer doesn't get what they paid for? Definitely will not be ordering from this Panera again under any circumstances."
"47","The cashiers seem like you're inconveniencing them, the counters were dirty and many tables had crumbs and was not clean.  The bathroom had no soap. And they ran out of milk, half n half, and had only slim milk for coffee at noon on a Saturday. The dispenser was sticky and nobody seemed to care.  Please panera, come fix this place. The wifi doesn't work. Mgt needs to evaluate how badly managed this place us"
"48","The avocado on my turkey avocado BLT consisted of two pieces, both completely raw, inedible with parts of the seed still attached :(  on top of that there was no dressing in my Greek salad.  It really sucks to spend 15 dollars to get something like that!! I could have gotten an Applebee's dinner for that price."
"49","I work at a panera location close by and asked for cups for water if I could have the medium size (because we get any self serve drinks for free) the manager was very rude and unprofessional he kept telling me he would call the panera I work at and ask them if I worked there. He was trying to threaten me or something when I have been working there for quite some time now. I just think that they need to get some more professional managers in there. Poor customer service!!!"
"50","They basically threw my food together and didn't care I had a avocado peel still on my sandwich and was only a piece of avocado and the they just threw a broke up loaf of bread in my bag"
"51","Rude customer service. The cashier acted as if we were inconveniencing her. And got an attitude when she gave me my food and I told her it was to go. She should have asked when I placed my order. I blame these types of attitudes on management. Why would you allow workers to act like this? Clearly from the reviews on here this is a problem at this location. Stop hiring people that are not friendly and that give bad customer service. Or better yet, teach them how to do this and expect nothing less."
"52","I love Panera, but not this one. If you want to use the catering service select a different cafe. Each and every time I ordered catering there was an issue and I order catering often.

"56","A standard panera. Place is not the cleanest. Two floors, lots of tables, good for groups and studying."
"57","Had food catered by this Panera location for a meeting I was hosting at my job. Delivery driver spilled half of the soups that we ordered in the parking lot. When asked about getting the money for the spilled soups refunded, we were instructed to call the Panera directly. Called them and got the run around about getting a refund because they wanted the card number again. It was a company card that our director was in possession of, and he wasn't in the office; so I waited until the following day to call back.When I called the following day I was made to feel like I was being less than reasonable for wanting a refund for the spilled soup. The lady brought up how it spilled in transit. I felt bad for the delivery driver; but that doesn't change the fact that we ended up short on soup for half of our guests. I also advised the lady that we did not receive baguettes for the soup we ordered. She told me they were packed in the bag (which they weren't) and proceeded to try to explain what a baguette was as if I didn't know. At that point, I was over it, and I asked for a refund for the spilled soup as well as the $20 tip charged to the card prior to service. She seemed surprised, possibly even insulted. I'm not saying accidents don't happen, but what ever happened to taking the initiative to make things right when a paying customer doesn't get what they paid for? Definitely will not be ordering from this Panera again under any circumstances."
"58","The cashiers seem like you're inconveniencing them, the counters were dirty and many tables had crumbs and was not clean.  The bathroom had no soap. And they ran out of milk, half n half, and had only slim milk for coffee at noon on a Saturday. The dispenser was sticky and nobody seemed to care.  Please panera, come fix this place. The wifi doesn't work. Mgt needs to evaluate how badly managed this place us"
"59","Where to begin with this Panera location! Oh my. I love Panera and go there often for lunch, coffee, and for a place to study. I'm usually very satisfied with my meal and service, even though I think that the company overprices their items. However, my family and I had a HORRIBLE experience at this location. We went there for lunch, and the restaurant was mostly full with students studying. The only table open was one close to the back near the bathrooms. Typically, this wouldn't be issue, but at this location, it was. My father went into the men's bathroom and commented that it was the grossest bathroom he had ever seen in his life. We told one of the workers about the bathroom, and she proceeded to prop the men's door open to clean it. Given that we were at the table by the bathroom, the smell was horrendous and making all of us gag. My mother then asked the worker to close the door because we were going to be eating, and she rolled her eyes and didn't do it. At this point, we were already having a horrible experience, so we called the manager over. We told her what was happening, and she couldn't care less. She offered no help, and the bathroom door STILL was not closed. After all this, we received our food. I had ordered a full caesar salad and cup of soup. There were about two chopped pieces of romaine lettuce in my salad, and my cup of soup was half full. Once again, we called the manager over to ask about the portions, and she said she was ""just the manager"" and couldn't do anything about it. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION! Rude, inconsiderate workers who don't care that customers are paying $50 for a lunch for 3 people."
"60","I love Panera Bread, especially this location. My food is always out quickly and the temperature is spot on. I have visited this Panera when out of town guests, friends or family are in town. I've even met here to sign papers. This location is friendly and inviting. I've even seen multiple people use the space to have meetings and interviews."
"61","I like Panera's food and I typically have a good experience there but my visit tonight was terrible.I visited at 6pm and it wasn't very busy at all. I ordered chicken soup in a bread bowl. They were out of bread bowls. OK, disappointing but I ordered a cup of soup anyway. That's all I ordered...a cup of chicken soup. And then I waited...and waited...and waited. After 20 minutes, only one person ahead of me had gotten her food order and it was clear that I wasn't getting my food anytime soon. So I returned to the register to cancel my order and ask for my money back. The kid working the register went and got a manager. More waiting. He cancelled my order and returned my money, and never spoke to me the entire time. I was in that Panera for almost 30 minutes and left without getting any food.So, to recap: no bread bowls, 20+ minute wait for soup, another wait for my money back, an unpleasant manager. Overall, terrible experience. If I could give this review zero stars, I would do."
"62","I went to Panera frequently (embarrassingly frequently) during my first two years of medical school in Pennsylvania.  Since I moved to Ohio, I haven't been here as often, partly because I'm burned out on it, and partly because there's better options in the neighborhood.  However, every once in a while a craving strikes and I make a visit.For whatever reason, this location does seem a lot slower than what I've been used to in the past.  This is especially problematic if you're trying to get a coffee and pastry to go in the morning.  Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had any problems with the employees being unfriendly or lazy, just not as quick as I'm accustomed to.  On the bright side, my to-go online orders have always been ready on time.  If you are planning on spending time to work or visit here, timeliness isn't as much of an issue, and then it's not such a bad location.  There are more outlets than I'm used to finding, WiFi works reliably, and the store itself is pretty clean.I may not be a regular here like I've been in the past, but it's not a bad spot to end up for lunch, especially if you're hungry for tomato soup."
"63","First off let me just say the service was slow. It took 15 minutes just to get a sandwich and a smoothie. The smoothie was horribly mixed......NOT worth $4+. Other than that the food was not bad at all."
"64","Very, very disappointing experience I had here. We walk in(me and boyfriend) and immediately you can see they only have three kinds of their bagel selection versus their normal 9-10 selection size. So we ask the employee if that's the only bagel selection they have and she replies, ""Yeah that's all we have, we ran out of everything else, we always run out."" It felt as if I should have known before I even asked that they ran out and that it was common for them to run out like this. So then we wanted to get a soup and a bagel and she recommends we get the bagel and drink so that we could add the bagel for 99 cents. We felt like we were getting some sort of deal, in reality we were not and the price still came out to be $18 including the cream cheese and everything.We realize the cashier doesn't make prices but we were definitely under the impression it'd be slightly more inexpensive to buy our items this way and it really didn't make much of a difference. Lastly, as we're waiting for our bagels, we were told they're out of both of the cream cheeses that we had asked for. Hazelnut had been discontinued, apparently, and the Hazel Walnut was out of stock. We settled for the blueberry which was still really good.Our soup was nice and hot and tasted great, on the plus side.Unfortunately, the shortage in bagels, cream cheese, and friendliness from the employees yielded this experience 2 stars. Far from my usual Panera experiences. I hope the next visit is not this way and I can change the rating."
"65","I love Panera and order delivery all the time, but this location is terrible. I was there for maybe 10 mins and saw at least 3 people get the wrong food. They forgot the chicken on my CHICKEN Caesar salad!"
"66","The employees all seem very unhappy to be here.  I'm not even saying they aren't making the effort to smile, they seem to be making the effort to frown.  Doing there job seems to be a pain.  Seemed annoyed to answer questions.  The facility is nice and the food is good like any other Panera but portions are small compared to price."
"67","I'm so disappointed with this service and place. Last time I came in (on Wednesday 8/30/17) it took them about 15 minutes AFTER I ordered and paid to start making my sandwiches. Then while they were making them the girl kept getting distracted and stopping to talk to other employees. Meanwhile, they didn't even make the sandwiches at the same time, so once the second one was made, the first one was cold from sitting there and the general manager Heather just stood by and watched. I came again today (Friday 9/1/17) and called 15 min before I arrived to place my order. When I got there, they didn't even start making my sandwiches yet. Once again, I had to wait probably 15 minutes and once the sandwiches were made, they were both completely wrong. I ordered two turkey sausage egg white & spinach sandwiches, one on a plain bagel, one on a cinnamon raisin. When I got my sandwiches, one was on an everything bagel and one was on a sesame. Also, both were regular sausage with tomato and cheese. When I asked for a refund the general manager heather just stood there once again and did nothing. Ironically, a man walked up behind me and asked if his second sandwich was re made yet because they messed his order up and he had been waiting for a while as well. I'm so disappointed, this was such a waste of time and money. I would give this place negative stars if I could."
"68","My delivery today was an extreme disappointment. As soon as I opened the door and greeted my delivery driver, she immediately said, ""You forgot to tip,"" in a very rude manner. My plan was to give her a cash tip instead of tipping on my card as usual. I go back into my house giving her a tip, and she proceeds to snatch it out of my hand. I'm very disappointed and completely turned off by her attitude, for I don't HAVE to tip her. I work in the restaurant industry myself, and I don't appreciate non-tippers; but this woman basically demanded her tip as if she was entitled. You don't demand tips, and this is how you have employees? Never getting delivery again."
"69","The food was as good as any other Panera but the tables were dirty and the bathroom was not just dirty but had graffiti in marker (which you can wipe off with some Goof Off) and this was well into the lull between lunch and dinner.  The young women behind the counter were goofing around and talking.  Someone's not managing right."
"70","If you see this Panera, KEEP DRIVING!  The service is slower than slow, and the staff is rude.  The employees are too busy socializing in clusters to work.  Complaining to managers does nothing.  I'm surprised this horrible location isn't closed yet."
"71","Terrible service!We called in an order for pick up and every single thing was wrong. No chicken on salad, cold grilled cheese, no dressing for salads, bad avocados. Terrible service and food."
"72","I do not need to say anything,check the pictures say is all!!!! I am really upset!!! This panera needs a new manager for sure!!!"

"74","Wanted some pastries and to see that they were covered in flies/nats  I brought it to the attention of the manager Stacy and she said there was nothing she could do about it.  Notice the pics with the flies!"

"77","Went to cicis this past weekend and I  will no longer visit this particular location.Restrooms were nasty,the employees used to be outgoing and friendly now they act like rehearsed robots.Atmosphere has changed so much in the past month or so.The food was ok but not plentiful.I was a so pleased with my past visits but no longer now.Good bye Cicis at Ridgepark"
"78","If I could give this place zero stars I would. First, the place is disgustingly dirty. Your feet literally stick to the floor when you walk. I would love to see some sort of health inspection because there is no way it is up to code. Second, the food is below average. I've been to different locations where the food was much better. Do yourself a favor and order Pizza Hut."
"79","Not clean. Floor counters employees So much diversity in pizza choices there was none. When I ask if I could order one for the table something that usually they bring out immediately - I was told it would be a 45 minute wait. Really?"
"80","This place is actually really great if you're on a diet. You're guaranteed to see or smell something that will make you lose your appetite. Need to use the bathroom? You'll have to walk through the back hall which will either smell like a dumpster or vomit. Shame these places are so filthy. The cheesy garlic bread is actually phenomenal. And I know others who feel the same way about the cinnamon rolls."
"81","kids loved it,  pizza was great, fresh,  new stuffed crust pizza is really good !!"
"82","First off stood there 5 before anyone came so I can pay then place is dirty as bath room at Browns game pizza was worth the money but I really am not picky it's worth the money but I will not be back here again people just as dirty as the floor damm sitting here and people just drop food all over I would not tell anyone to come here"
"83","Dirtiest place in Brooklyn hands down. Makes a dumpster out back more appealing to eat out of. Tables are never cleaned, plates and silverware usually have leftover food on them. There is always pop spilled everywhere near the machine and the bathroom quite literally smells like your local dump. Staff is friendly, but I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't insects and rodents all throughout the restaurant due to huge lack of cleaning and hygiene. It's a shame they let a place get this bad, it use to never be like this."
"84","Cici's Pizza on Center Ridge Rd in Rocky River OH was horrible. We were there in 2014 and they were out of pastas and sauce.  The pizza has fake cheese and oil topping that looks like real cheese. We'll never go back. Don't waste your time and money. Sad to say but Golden Coral is better."
"85","Let me start off by saying that I know buffets all have their downfalls, but this place absolutely takes the cake.   Every table we attempted to sit at was sticky, dirty, or both. The floor near the fountain drink dispenser had ice everywhere & nobody bothered to clean it up as though it wasn't dangerous in any way. There was a worker walking around with a cart & clearing off plates. That cart looked like it was full of diseases & smelled like roadkill left under the hot sun. Also, there is nothing more appetizing than seeing boogers stuck to the window that you're sitting next to.   The food is mediocre at best. The bathroom gave me the need to shower for twice as long as I normally do, & my iron stomach finally found its kryptonite."
"86","If I'm not craving for buffet pizza, I'm not going there. This place really like a garbage restaurant, it is really dirty to dine in. Food wise is great for the price, too bad other cleaner Cici's pizza is closed."
"87","Walked in to cici's paid for our buffet and before we were even seated we noticed a rather obese man at the bar grabbing pizza with his bare hands his bare underbelly rubbing all over the bar  and his dirty clothing dragging all over the pizzas. We immediately turned around,  asked for a refund and walked out. We reported it to the management but from watching on our way out nothing was done."
"88","Let's just get this out of the way right now. This place isn't Angelo's Pizza or some place that's going to serve up some gourmet pie with unique cheeses and meats. If you're expecting a unprecedented culinary experience, don't go here.However, if you're looking to spend a little and to get a lot to eat in a fun atmosphere, this is the place to go.The manager here is exceptional. He asked us what type of pizzas we wanted him to make multiple times, and he even brought a few pieces out to the table for us. The guy's personality was infectious and jolly and he really made our eating experience a lot of fun.There are some really great pizzas here, in my opinion. The thin crust pizza is good, and so is the BBQ chicken pizza. I always have several helpings of the various types of cheesesticks too. The dessert pizzas are quite good as well. Also, it's good to get a few vegetables in the mix, so be sure to check out their green salad.Sure, there's kids everywhere and the place may not be immaculate, but it's nothing that a personal-sized bottle of hand sanitizer won't fix.I always eat way too much when I come here, so I don't come here very much. When I do, though, I've never left disappointed. Lower your expectations, open your mind, be ready to have some fun, and you won't either!"
"89","Took the kids to Cici's recently and we enjoyed the $5.00 pizza buffet.  They had some tasty pizzas and some not-so-tasty pizzas.  The stuffed crust pizzas were really good.  My favorite was the stuffed pretzel crust pizza.  It tasted good, was fresh, and had a yummy filling.  You can't beat the price.  Plus, my kids are picky, but Cici's has a pizza for every pallet. Free refills on drinks is always a good thing.We'll probably visit again."
"90","This place is actually really great if you're on a diet. You're guaranteed to see or smell something that will make you lose your appetite. Need to use the bathroom?

And I know others who feel the same way about the cinnamon rolls."
"91","kids loved it,  pizza was great, fresh,  new stuffed crust pizza is really good !!"
"92","We decided to eat here after dropping someone off at the airport and heading back home.  The kids, for the most part, enjoyed the pizza; however, the reviews that compare this restaurant to a dumpster are not lying.  Even though the price is cheap, we still deserve a clean place to eat.  The restaurant is disturbingly disgusting.  The workers were mopping up messes, but the mop water smelled putrid. I felt so bad for taking my kids there. I will give the restaurant an extra star because the people that work there were friendly and doing their best to keep up with the throngs of people. Still, no other word but disgusting.  I made the kids take their shoes off even before getting into the car because the floor looked THAT disgusting."
"93","To be honest, I have been really a loyal fan of this sub. Both my husband and I like the grilled sandwiches here very much. But today, I have to submit a complain here. I ordered two grilled sandwiches by phone around noon. (2018-03-7 10:17am) The experience is very very unhappy. The man who answered my phone speak in a very unpolite tone which makes me feel very uncomfortable. At the beginning, I asked to order two medium grilled sandwiches. He asked me which kind. I said I want to build my own. Then he asked me again which kind? I answered I wanted to build my own sub. After that, he start to be rude in his tone and He don't ask me what kind of bread that I want, what choices do I have for the meat, vegetables,...  He just waited there and when I said I want all the vegetables except olives, he said I have to name all the vegetables that I want but do not providing me any choices!!! When I finished my order for the vegetables, he didn't ask me whether I need any source or cheese. Just told me the time that it would be ready and then hang up the phone! You can not imagine how hard his tone is and this experience make me feel do not want to eat sub or anything anymore!!! His tone when he speaked to me makes me feels like I am his enemy!A fan who loves your sub"
"94","This Dibellas sucks monkey ass literally! They can't comprehend your order correctly then have attitudes bc they fcked up! Never again ! Ain't no starts bihhh"
"95","I am disappointed in management not responding to a complaint. I ordered a vegi sub, being vegan, and told the girl I wanted every vegi. When I got gone it I rained every meat they had. I had to pitch it. Tried contacting the location and received no response back. Poor customer service the girl who made sandwich was very nice bit management needs to figure out how to deal with issues"
"96","The 1 star represents the service not the food.  Came in at 3 pm in the afternoon and nobody was in there.  Two people behind the counter socializing and didn't even acknowledge we were there until 10 minutes of standing there.  By the way we were only a foot away from them and said they would be with us soon while doing nothing.  Took our order by asking ""what do you want"".  Only ordered two subs and my wife's sub she said no olives and don't toast it in which the ignored both requests.  Took there good old time making it.Only writing this because we love the food and hope service gets better so they can last.  We know the chipotle down the street had to fire rehire everyone and start from scratch because of service issues.  Looks to be a trend."
"97","I ordered ahead on the way to a concert and the gentleman answering phones told me 10 minutes. I arrived 15 minutes later to my order not ready and ever better, not yet started. There was only one person talking orders / cooking and three others hanging by the register having a conversation. I waited to pay and 5 minutes into me waiting I interrupted to ask someone to ring me out.. Spoke to who seemed to be the manager cooking / taking openers about the wait and all she said was 'oh sorry'. I had to wait an additional 25 minutes for my food to be ready! That's 40 minutes!!  Genuinely disappointed with this location. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!"
"98","I thought this place was great! I've never eaten here before but I'm a huge fan of their bagel style hoagie rolls! They were so good and make these subs a lot more filling for me. Be careful when ordering sizes and ask their staff because everything is a lot bigger than you would expect. This was very reasonably priced and the staff makes your hoagies pretty quick. I will definitely eat here again!"
"99","I love DiBella's.  Absolutely fricken love this place. I wish soooo bad that there was one closer to me so if I had a complaint that would be it. The subs here are unlike any other place you will get them. Blows subway, penn station...you know what. You can't even say those names in the same breath bc DiBella's is that much better. I have got the got the Dagwood and the godfather before and they are both just ridiculously good. I have heard good things about their cheesesteak as well and I imagine that will be my next one I try. Just move close to Cuyahoga Falls please!"
"100","Pretty. Good. Cheesteak Sub.I. Ate. The. Whole. Thing."
"101","good food , sloppy unfriendly service. I just can't recommend eating here. get it to go. staff is unsmiling, and unfriendly"
"102","I worked up to courage to give Dibella's another try after my previous disaster of a sandwich on a prior visit.  I followed my own advice and kept it simple.Small cold turkey sub on everything bread.  Loved it.The bread is so fresh and chewy.  Veggies are fresh and the turkey was plentiful.  For a sub shop it gets 4 stars, just be careful what you order.  ie Avoid the Dagwood and avoid the hot sandwiches if it involves cold cuts.  It's quick and cheap (especially if you have someone to share a sandwich with).  It's comparable to Jimmy Johns with better bread and bigger sandwiches."
"103","First time to Panda Express not the greatest would of expected better it was not what I expected 2 hour drive.    The staff was ok not the greatest, not one of them smiled. The thing I did not enjoy was how the staff did not get the customer order right. . I feel like friendly ness of the staff could be improved and better. The low main noodles was so dry with no flavor.I find it kinda strange how majority of it entree items were missing hardly of a selection to choose from. The orange chicken was spicy had a bite to it the black pepper chicken was not black pepper chicken like you find at a Chinese buffet Thanks panda I won't be back"
"104","I'm shocked this location has anything higher than a 1 star rating. The staff is the rudest I have ever encountered in the food service industry by far. I've tried on a few occasions to "" give them one more chance "" and I just can't get past the blatant attitudes and sub par food. If you want decent Chinese food, go some place else because you're not getting it here sadly."
"105","So excited to have Asian style mall food back in Parma!  I eagerly await it's opening. I went on a Sunday night and was shocked! This place is nice on the outside but it is a DUMP on the inside.  20 employees were just standing around. No one said hello to me. And the food?   There greeted me 20 scraped empty trays left in the display and a dry Lo Main  and a nasty looking orange chicken. I left I was disgusted No way for me!"
"106","If you like waiting 10 minutes to order, never being able to get what you wanted, and getting inconsistent portions this is the place for you. The food it good but the service is just awful. I just walked out because they did not have rice of any kind. Will not return to this location"
"107","I am actually sitting stuck in the drive-through here at the Parma location writing this because there is no way out once you are in the line. I stopped here thinking I could save time (HUGE MISTAKE) by hitting a drive thru since all I wanted was a SMALL fried rice to accompany the dinner I was making. Needless to say I wait in the line only to be told that they don't offer small à la carte items and then if I would like a fried rice I have to pay $7.90 for a medium or even more for a large. Can we say bullshit? If you no longer carry a size perhaps you should put something over the menu that says it is not available. Or instead of being snotty perhaps offer to provide a small amount of rice in the medium container. Needless to say I will never come back to this location."
"108","Panda Express food is AWESOME as it ever had been since I tried back in California, When I saw that they were now here in Cleveland, I jumped with Joy!! All was great! Except the employees, they are rude, they made fun of a gentleman just because he wanted more soy sauce in his plate, the girl went to her manager mocking that they did not have gravy at that location! Talk about culture shock for this girl!! Even though I really like Panda Express, I will not return to this location cause of the rude employees! Learn to appreciate your customers and  their culture!"
"109","Loved this place when it first opened! There was an Asian guy that was the manager, perhaps he was a store launcher, things were awesome but have progressively gone down hill since... We just left there & went to Steak & Shake because the Shanghai steak I always get looked like it had been sitting there 2 hours... we went at 2pm, so I get how that could have happened...I also understand it seems they're doing what they need to to save money but I don't know if I'll take my chances going there... there has to be a a better happy medium to having the food I want to order and not breaking the bank... I gladly pay the premium price & would pay extra if they use asparagus in the recipe again"

"111","This is my favorite place for lunch, plenty of choices but I am always eat Orange Chicken."
"112","Yum!A bit too much cabbage in the chow meinThe fried rice is delicious (I love the soy sauce)We have eaten here several times and it has been good every time"
