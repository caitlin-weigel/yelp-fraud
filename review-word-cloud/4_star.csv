"1","This was a very nice brunch. The waiter was very quick and efficient. The atmosphere was very inviting and the food was delicious and filling. The 1star short of awesome was the silverware had some food stuck on it and that was a concern for me."
"2","I had the kill it skillet, bad for me, but filling and pretty good.  The service was fine.  Go here when you want an old style breakfast any time of the day."
"3","If you head to Cleveland, stop at what I consider one of the best breakfast places in town. I grew up on Yours Truly food in places like Chagrin Blvd's iconic, small location and Chagrin Falls. This morning I had a their very standard scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon and rye bread and everything was done to perfection. They just get breakfast right. Good, strong coffee, well done hash browns and crispy bacon. The Shaker Circle location is a place where everyone knows your name or they're trying to recall it. Parking is the only downside because it is mostly metered if you drive there, so have plenty of quarters handy!"
"4","Can't go wrong with breakfast here and I recommend all day breakfast menu if you are outside of breakfast hours. Great place to bring kids and nice to sit outside in the summer. Outside of breakfast, salads are very good and the chili is solid."
"5","This used to be one of my favorite local spots for breakfast but sadly the service is not what it used to be. Was seated and given coffee by the greeter at 11:23am and literally not one waitstaff stopped at my table until 23 minutes later and it was not busy. I literally had to flag down the greeter who seated me to tell him not one person stopped at my table all awhile they took orders from three other tables around me that came in afterwards, and I see other waitstaff talking, laughing and watching TV. Greeter took my order and I asked for the manager who even took his time coming out. At this point, I told the greeter to just cancel my order and charge me for the coffee. I'm not sticking around. My breakfast was ruined due to the lousy service. If there was a way I could place my order directly with the cooks and retrieve my food  and completely eliminate  any interaction with the waitstaff, I would... They absolutely suck. I hope the YT staff reads this message and GYST!"
"6","Though I love the Chagrin location of Your's Truly, I am sad to say I was disappointed in the Shaker Square location. The food was still up to par however the service left much to be desired. Multiple times throughout the meal, my friends and I genuinely thought our waitress forgot about us... I will still most likely come back because I love the food and the variety they offer but I may either stick with the Chagrin location or opt for takeout."
"7","Good food with generous servings. Gave it 3 stars due to service being a bit slow. Took 10-15 minutes to get have waitress acknowledge us. Food was hot and fresh when it arrived. Lots of Cleveland police officers eating there so we felt very safe ."
"8","I usually like BWW but this place was bad. Pretty empty when we got there at 8pm, a couple of 8-10 people groups came in and there was still plenty of room. First sign of trouble, ""I'll have a ... IPA, draft"", comes back in a bit ""we are out of that"", ""I'll have the Dogfish 60 IPA"" (a pretty standard IPA), comes back in a bit ""we are out of that, how about a Stone IPA"", ""Sure"" I say, comes back in a bit ""we are out of that"", WTF? My wife orders coffee, ""we are out of creamer, we do have milk"", OK, whatever. Put in a order for wings, pretty simple, it's in their name, it took 1/2 an hour for them to show up. They would stop by every 5-10 minutes to see if we wanted a beer refill, no thanks, I'll finish my food and get out of here."
"9","So I am a regular Bdubs customer. As an NCAA coach, I like my wings and sports. I was recently hired at a nearby NCAA college and on my second day here I decided to go to Bdubs. So a few things to point out....1. The bartender was very friendly. He as a male bartender. I don't remember his name. 2. The baseball wild card game was on. I asked if they can turn down the music and put on the sound of the game. They did it. And then the bartender started talking sports with us. He knew his stuff. That was excellent.3. Food was warm and good. Beer was good. No complaints there!So went to another Bdubs in the area and didn't like that one as much so I will be coming here as my first choice for Bdubs."
"10","It's Bdubs - what more can you expect? This location is fairly large, but despite the obvious availability of tables I'm usually waiting for an employee to amble over and get us seated. Luckily, there's a parking lot out back so you're not worried about your meter running out.The cool thing about this Buffalo though, is that it's home to the Sporcle trivia nights on Wednesday evenings. No charge at all to play, just go to the Game Master (sitting with his mic and laptop next to the bar), pick up the answer forms, pick a team name, and play. The game play is a little different from traditional trivia nights I've been to, but it makes it more interesting wagering points on your answers based on how confident you are. Since you're inevitably going to be waiting, you can ask your waiters for the handheld trivia game device which lets you play against other people nearby. A good way to pass the time and learn random facts. Or train for Trivia Crack I suppose. The other obvious choice is to open your mind to the hyper-stimulation provided by virtually every sports channel you could desire (in the US at least) arranged in collage-like fashion on the walls. Come to think of it, I don't even really know what color their walls are because my eyes never make it past the monitors and I've only gone at night.Tuesday (or Thursday?) nights are $0.50 wing nights, which is a good deal if you're a fan of their wings. Unfortunately, I've always felt like I was taking a gamble whenever I get their wings since some of the flavors that sound appealing are either way too saucy or just plain yucky, and others (that I wouldn't order myself but sample from friends) turn out to be decent. I'm actually more of a fan of their appetizers, which turn out to be surprisingly filling as well. The bathrooms are similarly hit or miss. Sometimes there's only one toilet that has been spared a messy fate and there's no more soap, and other times I emerge feeling refreshed and  clean."
"11","I have always been a fan of Olive Garden. This location seems to be very popular and can have up to a two hour wait, so plan ahead. Once in, the staff is very friendly and attentive. I am a picky eater but my requests didn't seem to phase them. I was pleased with the speed of service we received and will likely come back to this location (making sure that there is no wait ahead of time)."
"12","So I'll start off with the negative...the service was not that great. The waiter took forever to come to our table for drinks and breadsticks. So don't go when you're hungry because it's a wait. Other than that I loved the food! Their breadsticks are always warm and fresh. I also had their gnocchi soup which never fails to please me. I created my own pasta. I was very pleased they had whole grain pasta on the menu. So I had whole grain pasta and their parmesan pesto sauce with 2 Italian sausage links. It was a nice meal but as I said before it would have been nice if the server was around more."
"13","This location is under staffed. There aren't enough servers to accommodate all the tables in the Restraunt, but the service more than makes up for the wait ! I got the chicken Alfredo, my mother got the shrimp scampi, and my sister got the shrimp Alfredo. All of our dishes were cooked great. The gnocchi noodle chicken soup is top notch, it's like potato soup, chicken and dumpling, and chicken noodle got together and said, ""TASTE THIS!"" The garlic breadsticks were a bit heavy on the garlic salt. We were given a full table salad to take home, and each one of us were given personal to go breadsticks. Ask for Natalia, she's very friendly and good at her job! Super sharp, on point, and gives you plenty of Andes mint chocolates as you're gearing up to head out. 4/5 stars for having to wait to be seated so long in the middle of the day."
"14","Very nice ambiance here! My waiter was so nice and very patient. However, our food took long to come and so did our appetizers. Thank God my mom and I had salad and breadsticks to keep us busy. They were absolutely delicious. I would have given the restaurant 5 stars in spite of everything I stated above except this one thing I cannot let go. Guess what guys??? I got my plate of mushroom stuffed ravioli (only like 6 of them, really?) and one of the ravioli wasn't even stuffed!!! I got a flat ravioli pocket! I'm chuckling to myself as I write this because it's hilarious yet disturbing since Olive Garden is an Italian restaurant! So funny though! I'd like to leave on a good note though....I did get the dish for free after I mentioned it to the waiter. So thank you!!"
"15","The food was good last I visted. I eat out a lot. The service could be better, the waiting time too."
"16","Food is always alright once you get it and they usually get your order right.  The WAIT is awful.  I hate waiting while you can see empty tables.  I would much rather be seated and sipping on a coke waiting. This has to be the worst managed restaurant ever.  When you do have problems manager always have an excuse and never an apology or what can I do to make it right attitude.  I have been here with our family and extended family where they food was so slow to come out that people were done eating before the last person got their food.  I only go here as a last resort."

"19","The food was good last I visted. I eat out a lot. The service could be better, the waiting time too."
"20","Ordered the steak Gorgonzola, eating my food only to find someone's disgusting finger nail in there. Not to mention your standing waiting forever to be serviced when two girls are right by the front chatting it up paying no attention to the customers waiting to place a hold for their seat. I will make the drive out to the one on Parma from here on."
"21","The service was nice. The food is good.I didn't order something complicated but what I ordered was as good as it could be. And, it took a reasonable time to get it."
"22","I ordered a catering order for lunch for around 20 people. The delivery person was on time and we received everything that we ordered.I'm not the right person to actually be reviewing the food since working for Panera Bakery was my first job waaaay back when I was 16. However, everyone was happy with their boxed lunch sandwiches and catering sized Caesar salad. I would not hesitate to order another large catering order from them again."
"23","Do not go to this Panera Bread, the service is absolutely ridiculous. Every single time I go there my order is messed up. Today they gave me two different sandwiches and still did not get it correct. Don't waste your money and save yourself a headache, they should be out of business. The last time my order was messed up I called and was lied to by an employee who told me they were a manager. He then continued to call me vulgar names, the GM didn't seem to care about this."
"24","How does a Panera Bread get an overall score of 1 star?  Go there to find out.  You will never forget it.  Why JAB Holding Company doesn't do something about this location is anyone's guess.  I wish I could give it less than one star. Full disclosure:  The *food* (that we actually got) was fine.  :-O"
"25","I love Panera Bread, especially this location. My food is always out quickly and the temperature is spot on. I have visited this Panera when out of town guests, friends or family are in town. I've even met here to sign papers. This location is friendly and inviting. I've even seen multiple people use the space to have meetings and interviews."
"26","Let's face it Cici's is far from gourmet pizza. What is nice about the buffet here is the diverse array of options on the buffet at any given moment. If you like pepperoni... there is a pepperoni... if you like vegy... there is a vegy... this is definitely good value for the money."
"27","For $6 to get all of the pizza you can eat. You can have any kind of pizza you can dream up using the toppings they have. That being said it's not really quality your getting here, just quantity, as much quantity as you want."
"28","Yup, got to love the made to order, hot subs.  Even their cold cut subs are pretty good.  Their bread is all fresh and large.  So you do need to be careful, because a medium is a large sandwich.  So my approach is to get a medium, then take all of the contents of one of the halfs and put it into the other.  Wastes bread I know, so save it to snack on if you like.The restaurant is old school and and only has booths.  The booths can only hold 4 adults, so not great for larger groups.The sandwiches are made to order, so at lunch you could end up waiting in line.  Worth it if you have the time."
"29","I'm in love with these subs! I get the Veggie with everything except olives. It was like a party in my mouth!The small had to be at least 7"". I almost couldn't finish, but pushed on because it was so delicious.Take a minute and join Club Bread. I received a small sub for free. This would likely become my sub establishment of choice if it were closer to home.Great food and great service."
"30","Stopped in for lunch. Ordered the godfather. I give the sandwich a thumbs up. If you get a large sub, it is huge!"
"31","Fabulous bread and decent amount of meat on BIG sub. My medium is basically two lunches. Tasty pasta salad and no problem with big order for entire office."
"32","I worked up to courage to give Dibella's another try after my previous disaster of a sandwich on a prior visit.  I followed my own advice and kept it simple.Small cold turkey sub on everything bread.  Loved it.The bread is so fresh and chewy.  Veggies are fresh and the turkey was plentiful.  For a sub shop it gets 4 stars, just be careful what you order.  ie Avoid the Dagwood and avoid the hot sandwiches if it involves cold cuts.  It's quick and cheap (especially if you have someone to share a sandwich with).  It's comparable to Jimmy Johns with better bread and bigger sandwiches."
"33","This place sucks!!! I get there at 8:30 and they are already closed and have cleaned everything up. I come back another night earlier and they are already cleaning up, but they let me order I order a medium turkey, ham, and bacon hot sandwhich with provolone and tomato, lettuce, and mayo. I receive my sub and it is a small sub does not have any bacon, no lettuce and no mayo!"
"34","Very good subs, they have great bread and they load the sandwich up with meat.  We order at work all the time for meetings and people absolutely love them.  They are also reasonably priced for what you get.  My favorites are their tuna, the Dagwood, and the Godfather.  Make sure to get their ""everything"" bread, it is just like an ""everything"" bagel.  Delicious."
"35","I just left the restaurant with a sub meal to go. I was greeted promptly and everyone seemed very nice. While waiting for my food, the woman making my sandwich at the grill corrected another employee about the prep, which quickly turned verbally combative in nature. All of this while 3 customers, me included, stood by not knowing what to do during the exchange. If the woman was a manager, she should know to bring up needed information away from customers, not call employees out on the spot, for all to see AND hear. I was so embarrassed by the spectacle, I will NOT be returning. The sandwiches are very good, but not good enough to suffer through the humiliation of fellow workers. Great job on loosing a customer."
"36","Chains can only star so high in my life, because they can only be so good (or bad!). This location gets good enough marks. Dibella's is like Subway with better bread. Their small is actually twice the size of what I thought it would be. But they are not going to replace other sandwich shops for me. They really go light on the fillings unfortunately. I actually had to take half the bread away because it was just a horrible ratio of tuna to bread."
"37","Stopped in for lunch. Ordered the godfather. I give the sandwich a thumbs up. If you get a large sub, it is huge!"
"38","Fabulous bread and decent amount of meat on BIG sub. My medium is basically two lunches. Tasty pasta salad and no problem with big order for entire office."
"39","I am disappointed in management not responding to a complaint. I ordered a vegi sub, being vegan, and told the girl I wanted every vegi. When I got gone it I rained every meat they had. I had to pitch it. Tried contacting the location and received no response back. Poor customer service the girl who made sandwich was very nice bit management needs to figure out how to deal with issues"
"40","Stopped in to DiBella's with wife, mom, and son yesterday for a quick Valentine's Day lunch.  I ordered a medium Philly Cheesesteak, my son got a turkey and cheese, my mom ordered a Godfather, and my wife ordered a Buffalo chicken sandwich.  We paid, grabbed our chips and drinks, and then sat down with our numbers so the waitresses could see them.  They build your sammich and then hunt around the restaurant looking for your number.  When they see your number they give you the sammich and you can begin your indulgence.  DiBella's subs are larger than most sub shops because they give you almost twice the bread as other sub shops.  I'm really not a fan of all the bread, but it is fresh baked and very tasty.  I ordered my cheesesteak on 'everthing' bread, which had a great taste.The quality of the steak used on the sandwich was very good.  I tasted the meat by itself and it had a good texture and a great taste.  The rest of the sandwich was delicious.  I loved it.  It was almost too big to eat at one sitting.  The large sandwiches - don't even go there and less you want to share one amongst two or three people.  I tasted my wife's Buffalo chicken and it was also delicious.  My mom gave me a bite of her Godfather and that was really tasty too.  My son's small turkey sub was too much for him to polish off, but he made every attempt.  Excellent subs!"
"41","Only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because it is designed as a fast food Asian joint and is not a fancy, sit down type restaurant. Everything else about this place is stellar. You literally have over a dozen things to select from to build your plate. I'm a sucker for orange chicken and this place does it perfectly. Also their shrimp here is fantastic. Whenever I'm in Parma visiting my buddy, we tend to pick this place over other options. Good value and great food make this place a no-brainer."
"42","This is my favorite place for lunch, plenty of choices but I am always eat Orange Chicken."
"43","First time to Panda Express not the greatest would of expected better it was not what I expected 2 hour drive.    The staff was ok not the greatest, not one of them smiled. The thing I did not enjoy was how the staff did not get the customer order right. . I feel like friendly ness of the staff could be improved and better. The low main noodles was so dry with no flavor.I find it kinda strange how majority of it entree items were missing hardly of a selection to choose from. The orange chicken was spicy had a bite to it the black pepper chicken was not black pepper chicken like you find at a Chinese buffet Thanks panda I won't be back"
"44","They have decent food but I definitely consider it expensive for the quality you're getting. I've also noticed on multiple visits that none of the employees ever wear gloves-- like they all serve and cook the food bare handed."
